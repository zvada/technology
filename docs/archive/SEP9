---++ Problem/Motivation

Today, the VDT team continues to support !SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 9. We believe it is no longer used. Because it requires additional effort on our part as well as on the part of developers writing software to be used in OSG, we would like to remove support for it. This would affect OSG 1.0 and OSG 1.2. 

---++ Platforms being considered for retirement

We are proposing that we drop support for the following platforms:

| *Operating System* | *Architecture* |
| !SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 | all (x86-64, IA-64) |

---++ Why we should retire these SLES 9

To the best of our knowledge, SLES 9 is not in use in OSG. We are aware of the following pieces of evidence:

   * The LHC experiments officially support Scientific Linux 4 & 5, x86 and x86-64.
   * LIGO uses Debian 5 and !CentOS 5. 
   * The main user of SLES 9 was NERSC, and they have moved to SLES 10 and are unable to use our SLES 9 binaries. (We are working on ways to support their use of SLES 10.)
   * The OSG BDII reports shows no sites running SLES 9. Note that this only helps us understand what is running at the OSG sites, not what is being used by clients. The command we used to query the BDII is:
<pre>
ldapsearch -xLLL -h is.grid.iu.edu:2170 -b o=grid '(GlueHostOperatingSystemName=*)' \
GlueHostOperatingSystem{Name,Version,Release} GlueHostProcessorModel
</pre>

Interesting note: Although SLES 9 was released in 2004, it is still under "General Support" by Novell [[http://support.novell.com/lifecycle/lcSearchResults.jsp?st=-1&sl=-1&sg=1][until August 2011]]. Many people would consider this to be an old platform, but it is not old enough that we should drop it due to lack of support from the vendor.

---++ How we will retire these platforms

We will not actively remove support by preemptively removing binaries or disallowing the installation of the existing binaries. (This is to minimize risk by not making unneeded changes to the software caches.) However, we will do two things:

   1. We will remove SLES 9 platforms from the for [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.10.1/requirements.html][VDT 1.10.1]] and [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][VDT 2.0.0]].
   1. When we release new updates any VDT release, we will not build software on SLES 9. For each software update we make, we will mark the software as unavailable on SLES 9 and it will no longer install on them. This means there will be a gradual decrease in software that can be installed on these platforms.
   1. If we have support requests for SLES 9, they will be considered as low-priority requests to be handled only if it does not disrupt the work for other supported software and platforms in the VDT.
   1. We will stop running our daily tests on SLES 9.

This will affect OSG 1.0 and OSG 1.2.
