Reviewing Software Documentation
================================

To maintain quality documentation, we regularly review our documentation for clarity and correctness.

Performing a Review
-------------------

When reviewing a document, follow the instructions of the document to a tee as if you were completely new to the OSG.
Some common things to note and/or fix:

- After completing the instructions in the document:
    - Does the document inform you how to use the product?
    - Does the document tell you how to verify that the product is functioning?
    - Does the product work?
- Incorrect or out of date instructions
- Steps that may be particularly conducive to software or default configuration as a solution
- Lack of clarity or any other confusion you may have

Additionally, ensure that the document meets our [style](../documentation/style-guide) and
[layout](../documentation/writing-documentation#document-layout) guidelines, as well as correct spelling and grammar.
