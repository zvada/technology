OSG/HTCondor CREAM-CE Support
==============================


The CREAM working group has [recently announced](#Reference) official support for the
CREAM-CE will cease in December 2020.  With this email, we are soliciting
feedback on OSG and HTCondor’s transition plan.  OSG and HTCondor remain committed
to supporting VOs who need to access to CREAM-CE based resources throughout the
transition period; we will continue to support submission to CREAM-CE endpoints
and offer assistance to VOs to manage the transition.

OSG runs a glidein submission service that submits to grid infrastructures worldwide
on behalf of dozens of science projects.  This service currently submits to
approximately 100 CREAM-CE endpoints; we will continue to maintain the capability
to access these endpoints while we assist sites in testing and enabling ARC-CE
and/or HTCondor-CE replacement services.

The HTCondor team plans to support the CREAM-CE in the 8.8.x stable release series
and will maintain support for 8.8.x through December 2020.  CREAM-CE support will
remain enabled at the start of the 8.9.x developer series; in early 2020, the
HTCondor team will re-evaluate, based on community need, whether CREAM-CE support
will be available in the next stable series.

We realize that software retirements can be very disruptive; the OSG and HTCondor
teams are committed to assisting user communities through the process.  If you
believe our plan does not fit the needs of your user community, please contact
<help@opensciencegrid.org>.

Brian Bockelman, OSG Technology Area Coordinator

Todd Tannenbaum, HTCondor Technical Lead
