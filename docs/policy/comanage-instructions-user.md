Registering with the OSG
========================

!!! note "COManage administrators"
    This page is for users who want to register with the OSG.
    If you are a COManage Admin and need to approve a user registration,
    go to the [Approving COManage Registrations](../policy/comanage-instructions-admin) page instead.

OSG uses the [COManage](https://www.internet2.edu/products-services/trust-identity/comanage/) identity management system
to register OSG contacts.
COManage is backed by the [InCommon federation](https://www.incommon.org/federation/), meaning that users can register
with the OSG using their institutional identities with familiar single sign-on forms.
