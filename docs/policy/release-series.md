OSG Software Release Series Support Policy
==========================================

This document describes the OSG policy for managing its software releases. Use this policy to help plan when to perform major OSG software updates at your site.

OSG software releases are organized into __release series__, with the intent that software updates within a series do not take long to perform, cause significant downtime, or break dependent software. New series can be more disruptive, allowing OSG to add, substantially change, and remove software components. Releases are assigned versions, such as "OSG 3.2.1", where the first two numbers designate the release series and the third number increments within the series. Changes to the first number are infrequent and indicate sweeping changes to the way in which OSG software is distributed.

OSG supports at most two concurrent release series, __current__ and __previous__, where the goal is to begin a new release series about every 18 months. Once a new series starts, OSG will support the previous series for at least 12 months and will announce its end-of-life date at least 6 months in advance. During the first 6 months of a series, OSG will endeavor to apply backward-compatible changes to the previous series as well; afterward, OSG will apply only critical bug and security fixes. When support ends for a release series, it means that OSG no longer updates the software, fixes issues, or troubleshoots installations for releases within the series. The plan is to maintain interoperability between supported series, but there is no guarantee that unsupported series will continue to function in OSG.

OSG Operations will handle deviations from this policy, in consultation with OSG Technology and stakeholders.
