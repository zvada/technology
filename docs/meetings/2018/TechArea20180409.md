## OSG Investigations Team

GOC Transition is going to dominate the Investigations Team's time over the next couple of weeks.   I want to give general status of the transitions we are participating in.  So, I will give a couple of states:
    1. Have not started
    1. In development - Could be provisioning hardware, adapting software, installing software...
    1. Ready for testing - In a state where it can be tested by the consumers
    1. Deployed
