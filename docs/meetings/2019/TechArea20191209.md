### Discussion

-   Edgar updated the LIGO frontend to 3.6.1 and it seems to work but he got bit by a long-standing GlideinWMS bug with talking to 8.8 schedds
-   Marco is working on a fix for Edgar's bug this week
-   Edgar wants to containerize the factory next quarter. I asked that he prioritize containerizing the collector/negotiator along with the frontend bits to give GLOW frontends an upgrade path.
-   Edgar brought up an issue that the GlideinWMS proxy renewal was not creating RFC proxies. Mats has had some issues with some European sites not accepting RFC proxies but maybe we should lean on those sites to accept RFC proxies.


### Support Update

-   Oklahoma (BrianL): worked with Horst and XRootD developers to sort out logrotation issues
-   StashCache (Derek): Derek discussed stability issues with Stash origins. There may be some redesign needed for busy origins
