    -   Wait for Marian to update.
-   Github actions are cool.
    -   Modifying scitokens-cpp build process to use github actions.  Possibly applicable for others.  Reusable components!
-   (Derek) scitokens-cpp update - Make release.
-   (overdue) Simple validation of xrootd-monitoring-collector passed.  
    -   Data collected for production validation, now to correlate the 2 sources, collector and remote xrootd server.  Difficult step.
-   (in progress) Development on perfsonar tape-backup flow with John.
    -   Working with UChicago
-   (in progress) XRootD development for TCP stats.
