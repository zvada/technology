### Discussion

-   Edgar had a meeting with the LIGO folks last week:
    -   Sites accidentally got both HTCondor-CE from the CHTC Yum repositories.
        As we move all of the OSG specifics to the OSG CE metapackage, this should be a reasonable installation setup.
    -   LIGO depends on Edgar's RSV probe but we no longer support RSV. They need an alternative solution for 3.5.
    -   They're interested in another training, similar to the one Edgar/Christina gave them a few years ago, in Wisconsin somewhere.
        Unfortunately, the week they're planning on meeting is during the OSG All Hands.
-   AI (BrianL): Create GlideinWMS 3.6.1 ticket

## OSG Investigations Team

-   Working with Brian (and Frank?) on GRACC changes.  
    -   Higher priority this week, need to get it done.
-   Update of GRACC ES, which may require some development changes.  Hopefully updating... this week?
-   **DONE** NSF science bucket metadata for GRACC development.  
    -   **DONE** Need to discuss with the RCF team about field of science updates
    -   **DONE** Add science bucket on a dashboard (on payload screen, but can be added to more)
-   Development of scitokens-cpp for WLCG compatibility and testing framework.  Expect a new release in ~week or so.
-   Simple validation of xrootd-monitoring-collector passed.  
    -   Data collected for production validation, now to correlate the 2 sources, collector and remote xrootd server.  Difficult step.
-   Development on perfsonar tape-backup flow with John.
-   XRootD development for TCP stats.
