### Discussion

-   AI (TimT): Email Susan to discuss CA certificate packaging responsibilities
-   We receive feedback from community testing emails infrequently but tend to still have to contact specific people for testing
-   Our release cadence is very frequent with the new community testing policy and this seems to be pushing us toward a rolling release for the next release series
    -   To minimize maintenance effort, we would need something like an automated RSS feed for released packages
    -   It would be nice to have a better interface for testing feedback like what Bodhi has for Fedora


## OSG Investigations

-   Simple validation of xrootd-monitoring-collector passed.  
    -   Working now with Bockjoo on production validation.  Step 1 is making a public test collector
-   Working with Brian (and Frank?) on GRACC changes.
-   Update of GRACC ES, which may require some development changes.  Hopefully updating this week.
-   **DONE** NSF science bucket metadata for GRACC development.
    -   Need to discuss with the RCF team about field of science updates
-   Attended the RCF meeting to view the new osg-connect user management interface.  *neat*
