| November | 3.4.5, 3.3.30 | 2017-10-30         | 2017-11-06     | 2017-11-14 | 5 week cycle |

Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.
