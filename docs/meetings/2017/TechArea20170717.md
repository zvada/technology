Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

### Discussions

-   New GFAL tools issue causing problems for XENON1T, on CVMFS. -- need to check if it's a 3.4 issue only
-   New Condor 8.6.5 release this week to fix IPv6 bugs, but the new release breaks Dave Dykstra's Python modules so we're debugging that

### Support Update
