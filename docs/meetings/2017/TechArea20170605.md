Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.  


## OSG Software Team

-   [Singularity build](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/singularity-2.2.1-3.el7) in EPEL stable so we can exclude it from OSG 3.4.0
-   Bob Ball completed GUMS -> LCMAPS VOMS transition on one host last week, Horst will start the edg-mkgridmap -> LCMAPS VOMS transition this week
-   GridFTP/XRootD docs need updating for us with the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, any ideas on how to track down TWiki section usage?
-   RHEL VMU tests working for the being even though our RHEL subscription ended. Moate working on a RHEL7 VM exec host using his developer license.
-   Hadoop + Ganglia and GridFTP + umask questions sitting in osg-software list

### Discussions

-   OSG 3.4 singularity policy needs to be clear and set
-   Docs need to specify that the LCMAPS VOMS plugin is the preferred authentication method
-   Kyle should be able to help search for TWiki %STARTSECTION% usage
-   Mat will follow up with AGLT2 about a bug with the testing version of osg-configure that affects CEs
-   BrianL will find other edg-mkgridmap sites and coordinate with Suchandra to transition hosted CEs to LCMAPS VOMS plugin
-   BrianL will find owners for software mailing list issues
-   TimC and BrianL to discuss the future of the many OSG Software mailing lists
