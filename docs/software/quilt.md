How to Write a Patch
====================

You create one or more `.patch` files with diff and stick them in the osg directory. Then you declare the patch files in the header of the spec file with a line like `Patch0: py24compat.patch` and in the `%prep` section, just after`%setup`, you add a `%patch` line to actually apply the patch, like this: `%patch0 -p1` (where the `-p1` indicates that it should strip off the first leading component of the path in each file mentioned in the .patch file) Look at the mash package for an example.

The easiest way to actually create the patch in the first place is to use a utility called quilt. First you run `osg-build quilt` on the package directory and it will create a `_quilt` subdirectory that has the expanded sources and patches.

-   cd into `_quilt/pegasus-source-2.3.0`, then run `quilt push -a` to apply any patches that already exist (there are none for pegasus but there might be for other packages).
-   run `quilt new py24compat.patch` to name your new patch file.
-   run `quilt add <filename>` for each file you want to make changes to (you *must* run this before making any changes).
-   actually make the changes.
-   run `quilt refresh -p1` to have quilt add those changes into the .patch file. (The -p1 option to quilt refresh must be the same as the -p1 option to %patch0 in your spec file).
-   copy `patches/py24compat.patch` into the `pegasus/osg` directory and edit the spec file as above.

Don't forget to `git add` your new patch file before committing. Once you've tested your patch successfully, you should make that bug report and send them the patch. A bug report is looked on more favorably if it includes a patch to fix the problem.
