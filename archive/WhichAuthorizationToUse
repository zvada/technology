---+ Which Site Authorization Mechanism To Use

<blockquote>Following up on comments from Miron…

I propose that OSG install documentation should describe edg-mkgridmap as the default authorization mechanism for sites, with a clear list of conditions under which a site would prefer GUMS instead.

Why?

   * edg-mkgridmap is easy to configure and use
   * With tools like Puppet, running edg-mkgridmap periodically and distributing its output is easy
   * GUMS has extra capabilities, but they are not needed by most sites, and it is complex software that can be difficult to debug

I am *not* saying that we should drop GUMS or hide its documentation! Rather, it is a question of what a new site administrator will see first. Further, we can take this opportunity to define carefully (for ourselves just as much as for admins) what conditions or use cases should cause a site admin to prefer GUMS instead.

Comments?</blockquote>

This page contains follow-up information and a list of reasons to prefer GUMS over edg-mkgridmap.

---++ Follow-Up Items

   * Document process for switching from edg-mkgridmap to GUMS – essentially already done in the CE install guides (*BrianL*)
   * Under what conditions would sites prefer GUMS (see below)? (*BrianB*)
   * Who supports edg-mkgridmap? *Not an answer, but a pointer:* We get it as a source RPM from EMI (*TimC*)
   * Do we ship an appropriate set of configuration for edg-mkgridmap? Downloading default configuration, it appears there's quite a bit of garbage (10 of 63 entries don't work!) [TimC: And how many such updates fail in GUMS?] For example, if we assert that a CE should just map a handful of pilots, why does the default configuration result in an 25,000-line-long grid-mapfile? (*TimC*)
   * Should I worry about the quality of the software if one of the lines is '"449444" uscms01'? 449444 does not look like a DN to me... (*Carl*)

---++ Reasons to Use GUMS

Proposed:

   * To map users based on rules, not just to map from VO or DN &rarr; local user
   * To support multiple VO roles
   * To support gLExec
