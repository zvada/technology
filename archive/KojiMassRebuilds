---+ Mass RPM Rebuilds for a new Build Target in Koji

Whenever we move to a new OSG series (OSG 3.3) and/or a new RHEL version
(EL7), we want to make new builds for all of our packages in the new koji
build target (osg-3.3-el7).  Due to tricky build dependencies and unexpected
build failures, this can be a messy task; and in the past we have gone about
it in an ad-hoc manner.
 
This document will discuss some of the aspects of the task and issues
involved, some possible approaches, and ultimately a proposal for a general
tool or procedure for doing our mass rebuilds.

%TOC%

---++ New RHEL version vs new OSG series

---+++ New RHEL version

For a new RHEL version, we start with no osg packages to build against, so we
are forced to build things in dependency order.  Figuring out the dependency
order is possibly the most difficult (or interesting) part of doing mass
rebuilds -- more on that later.

---+++ New OSG series

For a new OSG series within an existing RHEL version, we have more options.
While it's possible to "start from scratch" the same way we would with a new
RHEL version and build everything in dependency order, this is not really
necessary if we take advantage of existing builds from the previous series.

A prior step is to determine the package list for the new series -- this will
be some combination of Upcoming and the current release series, minus any
packages pruned for the new series.  This should also be reflected in the new
trunk packaging area.  All the current builds for packages in that list (from
upcoming + current series) can be tagged into the new *-development (or
*-build) repos.  This should make all of the build dependencies available for
mass rebuilding the new series all at once (osg-build koji *).

After some consideration, I wholeheartedly endorse this approach for new
OSG series -- for all but academic exercises.  Rebuilding in dependency order
when all the dependencies are already built just seems like wasted effort.


---++ Doing scratch builds of everything first

Before doing the mass rebuilds in a new build target, it seems to be a good
idea to do scratch builds of all the packages in the current series first.
(Or, at least the ones we intend to bring into the new build target.) This
will give us a chance to see any build failures that have crept in (possibly
due to upstream changes in the OS or EPEL), and fix them first if desired, but
in any case avoid the confusion of seeing the failures for the first time in
the new build target.

Doing mass scratch rebuilds for an existing series is easy, as they can all be
done at once.

Relatedly, doing a round of scratch builds *after* successfully building all
packages into a new build target can also be useful, because it can reveal
dependency issues only present in the new set of builds.  Doing developer test
installs or a round of VMU tests may also uncover any runtime dependency issues.

---++ Options for calculating build dependencies

We can get dependency information from a number of places:

- scraping .spec files for Requires/BuildRequires/Provides and %package
  names<br>
- querying existing rpms directly on koji-hub and our OS/EPEL mirrors (rpm
  -q)<br>
- querying srpms from 'osg-build prebuild' directly for build requirements<br>
- inspecting previous buildroots to determine resolved build dependencies<br>
- use repoquery to determine whatrequires/whatprovides for packages<br>
- use yum-builddep to find packages with all build requirements available<br>
- using the repodata (primary+filelists) from rpm repositories, including:<br>
  - upcoming + 3.X development + external repos (Centos/EPEL/JPackage), OR<br>
  - osg-upcoming-elX-build, which includes them all<br>

One important aspect is that the runtime requirements are also relevant
for determining build requirements, since a build will require installing all
of the runtime requirements of the packages required for the build.

That is, ((A !BuildRequires B) and (B Requires C)) implies (A !BuildRequires C).

Combined with the fact that runtime requirements are transitive, that is,
((A Requires B) and (B Requires C)) implies (A Requires C), 
computing build requirements is a recursive operation, which can be many
levels deep.


Another question to keep in mind is whether to use versioned requires/provides
(ie, !BuildRequires xyz >= 1.2-3) or to only pay attention to the
package/capability names.  Similarly, whether to pay any attention to
conflicts/obsoletes.  These would add complexity to anything except the
standard tools (repoquery, yum-builddep) which already take these things into
account.  (And we may get pretty far even without paying attention to
versions.)

Note also that the dependencies/capabilities for a given package often varies
between different rhel versions.


---++ Pre-computing (predictive) vs just-in-time

Two different approaches to determining dependency order for building are:

- pre compute all dependencies based on an existing series/rhel version,
  OR<br>
- compute which remaining packages have all build reqs satisfied now

The first approach has the benefit of being able to determine the packages
that need to be built in order to accomplish a smaller subset goal first --
for example, to be able to install osg-wn-client.  (And, if there are problems
with resolving certain dependencies (say with osg-wn-client again), it will
become apparent earlier, as opposed to not until all possible-to-build
packages have been built.)  The limitation of this approach is that the
predicted set of files/capabilities that a binary package will provide may
differ between osg series/rhel versions, and as a result may be inaccurate for
the new build target.

The second approach provides somewhat more confidence about being able to
correctly determine which packages should be buildable at any point in time,
but (as mentioned above) it is a bit more in the dark about seeing the bigger
picture of the dependency graph or being able to build subsets of targets.

It may be useful to have both options available -- building from the list in
the second approach, but using the first mechanism to have a better picture of
where things are at, or perhaps to steer toward finishing a certain subset of
packages first.


---++ Package list closure, pruning

At some point (either in the planning stage or after building packages into
the new build target), we need to ensure that the new osg series/rhel version
contains all of its install requirements for all of its packages.  It would
probably suffice to do a VMU run that installs each package (perhaps
individually, to avoid conflicts).

But if we go about it more analytically, we may also get, as a result, a list
of packages which we previously only maintained for the purpose of building
our other packages (ie, that were never required at runtime for any use cases
that we cared about), which now, in the new target, are no longer build
requirements (directly or indirectly) for any packages that we care about
installing.  Packages in this category could be reviewed to also be dropped
from the new build target.

---++ Proposal / Recommendations

As mentioned earlier, my recommendation is that we treat a new OSG series
differently than a new RHEL version.

---+++ For a new OSG series:

- update native/redhat packaging area to reflect packages for new series,
  including upcoming + trunk - removed packages

- tag existing builds of packages in new list into the new development tag
  (eg, for osg-3.3-el6, tag the .osgup.el6 and .osg32.el6 builds into
  osg-3.3-el6-development)

- build all packages in new packaging area into new build target at once

- for all successful builds, remove corresponding old builds (eg,
  .osgup/.osg32) from the new tag (osg-3.3-el6-development)

---+++ For a new RHEL version:

- pull the repodata from the relevant *-build repo from koji:

  for pre-computing, use a build repo from an existing rhel version:<br>
    https://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/mnt/koji/repos/osg-3.2-el6-build/latest/x86_64/repodata/

  for just-in-time, use the new build repo:<br>
    https://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/mnt/koji/repos/osg-3.2-el8-build/latest/x86_64/repodata/

  the primary and filelists (sqlite) files can be used to get runtime requires
  and provides.  (Note that this includes packages from the relevant external
  repos, also.)

- generate srpms repodata for the current set of packages to build, with
  osg-build prebuild and createrepo.

  the primary (sqlite) file can be used to get build-requires.

- use sql to resolve direct dependencies at the package name level:<br>
  src-pkg: bin-pkg  (!BuildRequires)<br>
  bin-pkg: bin-pkg  (Requires)<br>
  bin-pkg: src-pkg  (bin-pkg comes from which src-pkg? only needed for
                     pre-computing dependencies)

- resolve this list into a full list of recursive build dependencies.

  Since this is recursive, there is no way to do it in a fixed number of sql
  queries.  However the above input list is already directly consumable by
  Make, which is designed to handle recursive dependencies just like this.
  Or we can write a new tool to do it in python.

- build ready-to-be-built packages<br>
- update our copy of the repodata from the regen'ed *-build repo, as often as
  new versions become available<br>
- update our dependency lists<br>
- repeat until all packages are built<br>
