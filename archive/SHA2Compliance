---+ SHA-2 Compliance

When a certificate authority signs a certificate, it uses one of several possible hash algorithms. Historically, the most popular algorithms were MD5 (now retired due to security issues) and the SHA-1 family. SHA-1 certificates are being phased out due to theoretical weaknesses — there are no known pragmatic attacks, but there is reason to believe one may be possible in the future. These days, the preferred hash algorithm family is SHA-2.

The certificate authorities (CAs), which issue host and user certificates that are used widely in the OSG, will default to SHA-2-based certificates on 1 October 2013; by that time, all sites will need to make sure that their software is ready to support certificates using the SHA-2 algorithms (as well as older ones). Some components of the OSG software stack have added SHA-2 support only recently. The table below denotes indicates the minimum releases necessary to support SHA-2 certificates.

| *Component* | *Version* | *In Release* | *Notes* |
| !BeStMan 2 | bestman2-2.3.0-9.osg | 3.1.13 | SHA-2 support; also see !jGlobus, below |
| !dCache SRM client | dcache-srmclient-2.2.11.1-2.osg | 3.1.22 | Major update includes SHA-2 support |
| Globus GRAM | globus-gram-job-manager-13.45-1.2.osg<br>globus-gram-job-manager-condor-1.0-13.1.osg<br>globus-gram-job-manager-pbs-1.6-1.1.osg | 3.1.9 | Critical bug fixes (not SHA-2 specific) |
| GUMS | gums-1.3.18.009-15.2.osg | 3.1.13 | Switched to !jGlobus 2 with SHA-2 support; also see !jGlobus, below |
| !jGlobus (for !BeStMan 2) | jglobus-2.0.5-3.osg | 3.1.18 | Fixed CRL refresh bug (not SHA-2 specific) |
| VOMS | voms-2.0.8-1.5.osg | 3.1.17 | SHA-2 fix for voms-proxy-init |

If a component does not appear in the above table, it already has SHA-2 support. This table will be updated if testing or usage reveals further issues.
