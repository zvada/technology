---+ CMS GRAM Improvement Requirements

---++ Requirement 1: Clean up Globus cruft

CMS needs tools that are enabled by default on the CE to clean up the old cruft that failed Globus jobs leave behind in the user home directories and the Globus temporary directories. By "old" we mean older than 10 days, though the number should be configurable. Specifically, the following files should be cleaned up:

   1. In each user's home directory:
      1. Old gram_job_mgr*.log files
      1. Old gram_scratch* directories
      1. Old files in the .globus/.gass_cache directory
      1. Old files in the .globus/job directory
   1. Old files in the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/tmp/gram_job_state directory

---++ Requirement 2: Change priority of the Globus gatekeeper

The priority of the globus-gatekeeper process should have a nice level and ionice level of 20 by default. This was requested by CMS as [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&pass=guest&id=5028][VDT Ticket #5028]]

---++ Requirement 3: Prevent fork job manager synchronization

We should apply the following patch to the fork job manager poll function so that when there are many Condor-G grid_monitors (which are fork jobs), they are not sychronized.

---++ Requirement #4: Extend Condor job manager to be able set accounting groups. 

Apply patch written by CMS that extracts FQAN from user's proxy then uses VO information to set Condor accounting group information. This is documented in [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&pass=guest&id=5838][VDT Ticket #5838]]
