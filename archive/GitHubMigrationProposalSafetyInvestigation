---++ Safety investigation of the !GitHub migration proposal

From Main.CarlEdquist:
<verbatim>
What kind of vulnerabilities are we concerned with?

1. "corruption" -- anything that destroys history; specifically, the ability
to do fast-forward fetches.

2. "garbage" -- an unauthorized or rogue user (or a rogue github) pushes
unwanted commits that do not destroy history.  ("Sufficiently-fat-fingered"
can also be considered rogue.)
</verbatim>

3. "destruction" -- someone hacks into github and pushes the "delete" button on
   a repo.

---+++ Preventing "corruption"

From Main.CarlEdquist:

<verbatim>
- If "corruption" happens on github, the automated fetch to the AFS repos
  will fail, and we'll be notified immediately.  Since non-fast-forward
pushes will (should) be disabled on github, this would be an indication that
somebody's not playing nice, and we may want to investigate that.

In any case, the AFS repos won't be changed, so we can force-push everything
back to github to recover.  (Temporarily re-enabling force-pushes for this
recovery.)

On the developer end, corrupted updates from the github upstream get
rejected by pulls.  New checkouts of the corrupted github repos (before our
recovery) will of course contain the corruption, so they can be discarded as
we'll direct everyone in an email.
</verbatim>

---+++ Preventing "garbage"

From Main.CarlEdquist:

<verbatim>
- If "garbage" commits make their way into the github repos; first someone
will have to notice.  If someone is trying to be sneaky and sneak something
in, it may not be obvious.  (The case seems about the same as for the UW SVN
repo.)  There are ways to protect against it (namely having everyone sign
all their own commits, and enforcing checking for this), but I suspect
that's more than we really want.

But if a bad commit is discovered (aha! gotcha!), and it's offensive enough
that we want to remove it from our repo entirely (instead of just adding a
further commit to revert it), we can 'git reset' the AFS repos to just
before the offending commit, optionally run 'git gc' to remove any offending
blobs from the object store, force-push back to github, and email everybody.

As a special case, if a 4TB garbage commit makes it to the github repos
(assuming github itself doesn't reject it!), then the automated fetches to
AFS would fail, exhausting the vdt disk quota on AFS.  In this case, the AFS
repos will not be in a corrupted state, and the garbage commit will not be
included in the repo, but a (large) incomplete temporary file will be left
behind (with an obvious name like objects/02/tmp_obj_YCIXgK).

We will have to manually delete such a temp file, and then force-push the
(unchanged) AFS repo back to github.
</verbatim>

---+++ Responding to !GitHub outages

From Main.CarlEdquist:

<verbatim>
There are two cases to consider.

1. Temporary outages.  (Kind of like when JIRA goes down  :)

2. Severe or permanent outages.  (When it's too long to tolerate...)


For temporary outages, developers can continue to commit to their local
repos, and do whatever development they want.  This includes making new tags
and cutting release tarballs to use as new upstream sources for builds.
Anyone can also clone or update from the official ones in AFS in the mean
time -- though as long as the outage is considered temporary, no one should
push back to AFS, but wait until it becomes possible to push back to github
again.

For severe or permanent outages (which someone with Say can determine), then
everyone can just switch their upstream (remote) back to AFS.

Something like:

    upstream=/p/condor/workspaces/vdt/git/software/<project>.git
    git remote set-url origin $upstream

for checkouts with direct AFS access; or for access via ssh:

    upstream=/p/condor/workspaces/vdt/git/software/<project>.git
    cshost=library.cs.wisc.edu
    git remote set-url origin $cshost:$upstream

Everyone then gets to play nice (no pull requests) and push directly to the
AFS location (like they do in FW's CONDOR_SRC git).  If someday github comes
back online, we should be able to just fast-forward push the updates to
github, and tell everybody to switch back.  (But, it's important that they
listen!)
</verbatim>

---+++ Recovering from repo destruction

Destruction of a !GitHub repo can be handled the same way as a permanent
outage, since once the repo is destroyed, fetches from it will fail. While we
wait for !GitHub to be usable again, we switch the location of the upstream Git
repo to the AFS repo, and work as above.

---+++ Preventing tag corruption

From Main.CarlEdquist:

<verbatim>
[2] Removing the '+' in the fetch refspec prevents non-fast-forward updates,
but tag updates are actually a separate issue.  Normally for a checkout, if
an upstream tag changes, a pull will not update the local tag.  Also, a
(non-force) push will fail for an updated tag (that is, it will refuse to
update a tag reference on a remote.)  But in our case, we have a bare repo
(not a working copy/checkout) and we do fetches, not pulls or pushes.  To my
horror, I have found no way to prevent tag updates via fetch to a bare repo.
If tags are included in your fetch, tag updates will come also.

(Again, tag updates will not get pulled into working copy/checkouts that
have the original tag, but the main issue is how to protect the tags in the
AFS repos from upstream corruption.)

I would very much welcome any suggestions on how to handle this potential
issue.  (@bb?)  So far, I have come up with two ways to protect against
this, both of which I consider a little ugly.

1. fetch to an intermediate bare repo, and then push to the main bare repo.
The fetch will update the tag, but the push will fail.  This has the
advantage of being able to detect easily when tag updates happen (which
should be forbidden, so we do want to know).  The downside is this approach
uses an extra staging repo.  (Then again, we could use that as an extra
backup...)

2. use a non-standard fetch refspec for tags; for example:

        fetch = refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*
        fetch = refs/tags/*:refs/tag-stage/*

Instead of fetching everything ('refs/*'), single out heads and tags, but
fetch tags to a non-standard location.  As a side effect, new tags will get
created in the standard location (under refs/tags), along with
refs/tag-stage, but tag updates will only make it to tag-stage, and will
(silently) not update the tags under refs/tags.  This appears to work, and
has the advantage of not needing a separate staging repo.  One disadvantage
is it does not automatically bring in 'other' types of refs (eg, github
'pull' refs), although if we really want them, we can list them explicitly
in the fetch list.  Also, this is a little less obvious to detect; there are
no failures, though if you parse the command output you can detect trouble
any time there is a tag-stage update, eg:

   8c1bcea..cec9488  v1.2.3         -> refs/tag-stage/v1.2.3

Also worrisome is that the semantics here don't seem to be clearly
documented... It would make me feel a little better if we could point to
something that says yes it's supposed to work that way.  But in any case,
I've confirmed it works in both git 1.7.12 and 2.5.0.  (So, the behavior
seems stable...)

---

Alternatively, if we are OK with just being informed of tag updates (instead
of preventing them), we can add reflogs for all tags, which under normal
circumstances will remain empty.  Making reflogs for tags automatically is
not really convenient in git; for some reason core.logAllRefUpdates works
for refs/heads but not refs/tags (which at least is documented), and
'git tag --create-reflog' only seems to create a reflog for a new tag.

We can add something like the following to the fetch script, after the fetch
command runs, to create reflogs for all new tags, and detect tag updates
from existing ones.

    # from $GIT_DIR
    for tag in $(git tag); do
        taglog=logs/refs/tags/$tag
        tagdir=${taglog%/*}
        [[ -d $tagdir ]] || mkdir -p $tagdir
        [[ -e $taglog ]] || touch $taglog
        if [[ -s $taglog ]]; then
            echo "Warning: tag $tag has a history..."
            git reflog refs/tags/$tag
            echo
        fi >&2
    done

</verbatim>

A third option is to have developers sign tags with their GPG keys.  That might
not prevent tag corruption, but it would let us know if it had taken place.
