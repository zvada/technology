---+ Project 23: !StashCache – Distributing User Data With !XRootD

The goal of this project is to support all OSG users who have common input data files, with an initial goal of handling up to 1 TB datasets. Users will upload copies of their data to predefined entry points and will set up jobs to fetch data without having to understand implementation details. Internally, !XRootD will copy files from the entry points to OSG caches that are located at or near OSG sites where user jobs run.

---++ The Problem

The two large LHC VOs, ATLAS and CMS, own storage at many OSG sites and use them as _storage elements_, or remotely accessible file systems. The storage element concept does not work for opportunistic VOs – without a mechanism for automated eviction, files stay in the storage element forever. Without access to site storage elements, opportunistic VOs cannot efficiently deliver files to individual jobs. The CMS and ATLAS systems for moving data between storage elements are robust and efficient, but have proven impossible for any other VO to operate.

Users not affiliated with ATLAS and CMS have few remaining choices for distributing data files, especially as dataset size increases. Currently, most of these users rely on HTCondor file transfer from submit to execute host, using on-site HTTP caches, or OASIS. All three mechanisms effectively limit the size of data files to less than 1&nbsp;GB. In 2014, over 30% of OSG cycles went to non-HEP users, and anecdotally at least OSG knows that some of those users have common input datasets that exceed the best-practice limits for available methods.

The general problem is quite complex; we choose to focus on “common input data”. We assume the user is running at least 1,000 jobs (lasting 1 hour each) across a common input dataset of at least 1&nbsp;GB.

---++ Deliverables

   * Publish an overview document for the OSG community with clear goals, problem statement, architecture, and guiding principles
   * Deploy Origin Servers – for end users to upload input data files
      * Provide integrated software so that a VO can easily install, configure, and manage an Origin Server
      * Deploy the OSG Connect Origin Server for OSG Connect users
   * Deploy data distribution system – internal to !StashCache, largely invisible to users
      * Provide integrated software and default configuration so that a site can easily install, configure, and manage a Cache Server
      * Deploy about 10 Cache Servers across OSG
      * Improve Cache Server software and operational processes to support central OSG management (service status, monitoring, and remote log viewing)
      * Deploy a central OSG Redirector at OSG GOC
      * Deploy tools so central operations can monitor system usage and failures
   * Deploy client tools – for end user jobs to access file data
      * Update and deploy OSG pilot jobs to include new environment settings and a new HTCondor file-transfer plugin
      * Deploy new client software to OASIS
      * Eventually, deploy client software that can provide direct POSIX access to user files without full local download
   * Publish documentation for end users, (Cache Server) site administrators, and GOC staff

---++ Scope

The goal of the project is limited by the following considerations:
   * Support will be for *input* data files, not output files
   * Support is intended for *common* data files that are used by many jobs
   * Files are expected to be up to 1 TB in total size and relatively few in number per job (&le; 10)
   * Files will be stored temporarily in OSG and removed as needed to make room for new demand
   * Once in the system, files are immutable – they will never grow or change
   * VOs are responsible for keeping their section of the distributed filesystem organized and consistent

---++ Risks

An initial list of possible risks to project success:

   * The technical design is not complete and may yet result in tasks that are more challenging and take longer than currently expected
   * Some technical work must be done by other groups (e.g., HTCondor, AAA) who have their own priorities and schedules
   * The plan calls for a new OSG service to run at the GOC (!XRootD redirector); the GOC has capacity but not infinitely so
   * The GOC must also update an existing production service (an HTCondor collector) to accept ads from !XRootD caches

---+++ Beta implementation (aka working prototype) - OLD WBS TABLE

The objective is to have an end-to-end implementation of all components, even if those components are still in testing or beta release form. Once in place, at least one brave user (FIFE?) will test the system and provide feedback on usefulness, functionality, etc.
