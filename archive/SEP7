---++ Motivation
For some time the CA certificates distribution process for OSG has consisted of
OSG downloading a release of the IGTF CA certificates distribution,
extracting the appropriate CA information files and putting those into
a pacman cache (also yum and apt repositories) which is referenced from
an automatic update process run at each site (most sites) so they
would get a new CA distribution as soon as the pacman cache was populated.
The same cache is used by production sites and ITB sites.

This process has a weakness because it does not allow testing of a new CA
distribution on the ITB independently of the production OSG.
There are three known cases where enabling this testing before production deployment
is important.
   1. The IGTF release process is currently undergoing changes to handle the CA hash form changes caused by openssl 1.0 using SHA-1 to compute the hash values while previously MD5 has been used.  We need to test this change before putting it out in production
   1. At times there are required changes to the format of certificates.  This SEP will allow testing new certificates before installing them in production. We had an example of this last fall when a bug was introduced to the EKU (Extended Key Usage) extension for certificates from the DOEGrids CA.
   1. A normal update of the CA certificates package so it can be tested quickly on the ITB before going into production.
For the case of testing a new format of certificates it may be that we will deploy a normally untrusted CA certificate on the ITB in order to test these end entity certificates.  In this case we would not include the untrusted CA certificate in the production OSG release and would probably only deploy it 
temporarily on the ITB.
It is expected that each case of testing a new format of end entity certificate will need it's own SEP writeup describing what is to be
tested and how long an untrusted CA certificate may be deployed on the ITB.

This SEP describes the process for deploying a release of a CA package
first to the ITB from an ITB specific software cache for testing before
it is released to the production OSG.



---++ Proposed Change
An ITB-specific software cache will be used to deploy an ITB-specific version
of the CA certificates package, independent of the software cache and
package versions used on the production OSG infrastructure.

Services running in the ITB will have their configuration for vdt-update-certs,
<tt>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-update-certs.conf</tt>,
reference the ITB-specific cache<br>
<tt>
cacerts_url = ITB specific URL
</tt>.<br>
A similar configuration change is needed for ITB sites that
get CA certificates via yum or apt (for rpm or debian packaging).

When the OSG security team informs the GOC that a new CA package
is available for release the communication will clearly state
if the release is for the ITB or the production OSG
and the GOC will then populate the appropriate
software cache from the svn repository.

The OSG Security Team will observe the results of the automated ITB testing
robot following the deployment of a new CA package release to see
what effects occur.

We expect to test this SEP first with case 1 mentioned above, the new CA hash format of 
the IGTF distribution.

---++ Expected Impact
A change in procedures for the security team, and for the GOC to handle
separately ITB and production versions of CA packages and distribution points.

A one-time change to the configuration of the vdt-update-certs process
on ITB services.

---+++ Example of new CA files
CA files are named according to the unique (withing IGTF) alias for the CA
and there are symbolic links defined pointing to those files.
The symlink names consist of the new and old hash values for the CA
subject name.  Below is the example of the DOEGrids CA.
<verbatim>
 certificates]$ ls -l * | grep DOEGrids
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      12 May  4 18:25 12d0da68.0 -> DOEGrids.pem
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      13 May  4 18:25 12d0da68.info -> DOEGrids.info
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      19 May  4 18:25 12d0da68.namespaces -> DOEGrids.namespaces
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      23 May  4 18:25 12d0da68.signing_policy -> DOEGrids.signing_policy
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      12 May  4 18:25 1c3f2ca8.0 -> DOEGrids.pem
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      13 May  4 18:25 1c3f2ca8.info -> DOEGrids.info
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      19 May  4 18:25 1c3f2ca8.namespaces -> DOEGrids.namespaces
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      23 May  4 18:25 1c3f2ca8.signing_policy -> DOEGrids.signing_policy
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root      45 May  4 12:22 DOEGrids.crl_url
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     395 May  4 12:22 DOEGrids.info
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     833 May  4 12:22 DOEGrids.namespaces
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    1436 May  4 12:22 DOEGrids.pem
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    2316 May  4 12:22 DOEGrids.signing_policy
</verbatim>

The hash values are obtained from openssl V1.0 using the flags <tt>-subject_hash</tt>
and <tt>-subject_hash_old</tt> where <tt>-subject_hash_old</tt> gives the same value
as openssl V0.9x flag <tt>-subject_hash</tt>.


---++ Affected Communities

ITB, GOC, Security Team

---++ Minimum Time for Public Discussion

Two weeks.

---++ Issues
---+++ Coupling to RSV CA probes
The RSV CA probes have had the reference location to get two files (INDEX.txt, cacerts_md5sums.txt) included in the code
and that needs to be updated in some fashion in order to have the RSV probes use a different reference location
depending for an ITB vs. production distribution point for the CA package.  Anand is leading that issue.
---+++ Can not deploy same CA package on ITB and production sites
The present (7 Jul 2010) CA package deployment process has all files published to different locations
for [[http://software-itb.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/][ITB]] vs. [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/][production]] sites.  This means that the same CA package tar file can not be used for testing
on ITB before deployment on production sites, without being copied.

| | | | |
| | ST | security team process that stores files to svn repository ||
| | VV | version number of package ||
| | N | rpm revision number ||
| | M | debian revision number ||

The GOC takes files from the svn repository and puts them into the pacman cache and yum/apt repositories.

*%RED%TODO%ENDCOLOR%* - talk with GOC (Kyle?) about process and see if it is useful to
have tar file published in single location or if it is better to copy it between ITB & production caches.


---++ Questions
   1. What time period of testing should be observed following a CA package release? I.e., how often are ITB sites updating their CA package?
