---+ Bestman 2 development process

---++ Subversion repository

The Subversion repository for Bestman 2 is hosted at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and owned by the SRM group there. 
   * *SVN URL:* https://codeforge.lbl.gov/anonscm/bestman/bestman2
   * [[https://codeforge.lbl.gov/scm/?group_id=54][Browse online]]

That web site has instructions for doing anonymous checkouts. If you need commit privileges, talk to Alex Sim. As of today, OSG Staff Neha Sharma, Doug Strain, and Alain Roy all have commit privileges. 

This repository has two relevant branches:
   1. *trunk:* This is where official releases of Bestman come from. All code that goes into this repository is approved by the SRM team at LBNL. 
   1. *osg-dev*: This is a work area for the OSG developers. No official releases will be made from this branch. The intention is that when work is ready and approved by the SRM team, it will be merged from osg-dev to trunk.

---++ Development process

The LBNL team will rarely make commits to the Bestman repository. When they do, they will inform us. 

The LBNL team would like to look over our commits for the foreseeable future,  so they can be sure there are no unintended consequences. They do have more experience with the code base. Therefore, the process to commit is:

   1. We develop whatever change we need. We commit it to the osg-dev branch.
   1. We email SRM team with information about the patch. This would include the patch itself (or a Subversion reference) and a description of what it is.
   1. The SRM team will provide feedback. 
   1. When approved, we will merge the change to the trunk.
   1. If the patch requires further work, the SRM team will either commit that work, or let us know what we should do.

---++ Cutting a release
When we want to cut a new release, we will:

   1. Agree on a new version number with the SRM team at srm@lbl.gov
   1. Commit any needed changes (including version number changes) as above.
   1. Use Subversion tags to label the release.
