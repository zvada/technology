---+ OSG Software Component: Hadoop HDFS

---++ Purpose

Hadoop HDFS is a storage technology used to store files in a distributed environment.

It has a namenode server that handles metadata and block locations.  The datanodes store the blocks of data (usually 128MB block size).

---++ Usage

Hadoop is used by about 10-20 sites or so around the OSG.

---++ Source

This is an Apache project.  We base our packaging off of the Cloudera distribution.  (CDH4 as of this writing).

---++ Packaging

*Repository:* OSG.

---++ History

Initially packaged by Brian Bockelman and Micheal Thomas (I think?) in 0.19 version.  It got taken over by Jeff Dost for the upgrade to 0.20.  Doug Strain has taken over for the upgrade to 2.0.0 (CDH4).

---++ Future

Transition to CDH4 and beyond.
