---++ Note on this SEP
This SEP is being written before the idea of SEPs has been explored and accepted in OSG, and before [[SEP2][SEP 2 (Retiring old platforms)]] have been accepted. Acceptance of this SEP is contingent upon the SEP idea and SEP 2 being accepted. Due to this, the comment period may be extended.

---++ Problem/Motivation

Today, the VDT team continues to support several platforms, but we believe they are no longer used by OSG users. Because they require additional effort on our part as well as on the part of developers writing software to be used in OSG, we would like to remove these platforms. This would affect OSG 1.0 and OSG 1.2. 

---++ Platforms being considered for retirement

We are proposing that we drop support for the following platforms:

| *Operating System* | *Architecture* |
| RHEL 3 | all (x86, x86-64, IA-64) |
| Scientific Linux 3 | all (x86, x86-64, IA-64) |
| ROCKS Linux 3.3 | all (x86) |
| RHEL 4 | IA-64 |
| Debian 4 | all (x86) | 

---++ Why we should retire these platforms

To the best of our knowledge, these platforms are not in use in OSG. We are aware of the following pieces of evidence:

   * The LHC experiments officially support Scientific Linux 4 & 5, x86 and x86-64. They no longer support Scientific Linux 3 or IA-64.
   * RHEL 3 is nearing the end of its lifetime. [[http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/errata/][It's in "Production 3 Life Cycle Phase" only until October 2010]]. This means that today it only receives "qualified security errata of important or critical impact and selected mission critical bug fixes", and it will receive no updates after October 2010.
   * LIGO uses Debian heavily, but has officially dropped support for Debian 4 in favor of Debian 5. 
   * The OSG BDII reports exactly one of these platforms in use, and it's a test computer at Fermilab used to ensure that we still support RHEL 3. Note that this only helps us understand what is running at the OSG sites, not what is being used by clients. The command we used to query the BDII is:
<pre>
ldapsearch -xLLL -h is.grid.iu.edu:2170 -b o=grid '(GlueHostOperatingSystemName=*)' \
GlueHostOperatingSystem{Name,Version,Release} GlueHostProcessorModel
</pre>

---++ How we will retire these platforms

We will not actively remove support by preemptively removing binaries or disallowing the installation of the existing binaries. (This is to minimize risk by not making unneeded changes to the software caches.) However, we will do two things:

   1. We will remove these platforms from the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][list of supported platforms]].
   1. When we release new updates any VDT release, we will not build software on these discontinued platforms. For each software update we make, we will mark the software as unavailable on these platforms and it will no longer install on them. This means there will be a gradual decrease in software that can be installed on these platforms.
   1. If we have support requests for these platforms, they will be considered as low-priority requests to be handled only if it does not disrupt the work for other supported software and platforms in the VDT.

This will affect OSG 1.0 and OSG 1.2.
