---+ Testing Slurm related components

---++ Basic background

This page goes through the steps needed to set up a slurm install on a VM.  This is a necessary prerequisite for testing Slurm related components (CE integration, gratia, etc.).   Note that the slurm setup used for this uses weak passwords for mysql.  It should be sufficient for a quick setup, testing, and then tear down but should not be used without changes if it will be running for any appreciable length of time.

---++ Before the installation
   1. need to have  a VM with 2+ GB of memory 

---++ Installation and setup

   1. Download scripts and config files:
      * cd /tmp/
      * git clone https://github.com/sthapa/utilities.git
      * cd  utilities/slurm
   2. setup and install slurm components
      * export username='USERNAME'   # user that jobs will run as 
      * export version='14.11.7'   # slurm version to install (e.g. 16.05.2 or 14.11.7)
      * ./slurm-setup.sh 
   3. After successful completion, slurm and slurm gratia probes should be setup and enabled.
 
---++ Running a job using slurm
   1. Generate test.sh with the following: <pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash

echo "In the directory: `pwd`"
echo "As the user: `whoami`"
echo “Hostname:"
/bin/hostname
sleep 60
</pre>
   2. run =sbatch test.sh=
   3. the output from the jobs should appear in the current working directory as =test.sh.[eo].nnnnn= where nnnnn is a job id
