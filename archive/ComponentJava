---+ Component: Java

This page is about supporting Java and the OSG packages that use it. Starting with OSG 3.2, we no longer ship a Java implementation, but we still deal with Java-specific support and maintenance issues.

---++ The java7 Compatibility Package

When we first moved OSG software packages from Java 6 to Java 7, the OS Java packages all provided virtual dependencies that included “7” in their names. Critically, we added the =java7= virtual dependency in *all* OSG packages that required Java, so that we could force the installation of Java 7. In late November 2013, the OS vendors changed the packaging of !OpenJDK 1.7.0 to drop the “7” identifiers and instead used ones without the “7”; for example, =java7= was replaced with just =java=. This change prevented our Java packages from resolving their dependencies and hence from installing.

Carl Edquist invented a scheme for introducing a compatibility layer of packages, such that all installations of OSG Java software would succeed, whether the old or new virtual dependencies were available. The source package was named =osg-java7-compat= and is described below.

---+++ Binary Compatibility Packages

   * <strong>osg-java7-compat</strong><br>\
     Provides: java7<br>\
     Requires: java >= 1:1.7.0

   * <strong>osg-java7-compat-openjdk</strong><br>\
     Provides: java = 1:1.7.0<br>\
     Requires: java-1.7.0-openjdk

   * <strong>osg-java7-devel-compat</strong><br>\
     Provides: java7-devel<br>\
     Requires: java-devel >= 1:1.7.0

   * <strong>osg-java7-devel-compat-openjdk</strong><br>\
     Provides: java-devel = 1:1.7.0<br>\
     Requires: java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel

---+++ How It Works

This is how the compatibility packages work in various installation or update scenarios:

---++++ No Java installed, Yum contains “old“ !OpenJDK (providing java7)
   1. yum satisfies java7 with java-1.7.0-openjdk, *done*
*or*
   1. yum satisfies java7 with osg-java7-compat, now requires java >= 1:1.7.0
   1. yum satisfies java with osg-java7-compat-openjdk, now requires java-1.7.0-openjdk
   1. yum satisfies java-1.7.0-openjdk with latest !OpenJDK package, *done*

---++++ No Java installed, Yum contains “new” !OpenJDK (providing java)
   1. yum satisfies java7 with osg-java7-compat, now requires java >= 1:1.7.0
   1. yum satisfies java with with latest !OpenJDK package, *done*
*or*
<ol start="2">
   <li start="2">yum satisfies java with osg-java7-compat-openjdk, now requires java-1.7.0-openjdk</li>
   <li>yum satisfies java-1.7.0-openjdk with latest !OpenJDK package, <strong>done</strong></li>
</ol>

---++++ Oracle (or IBM) Java 7 installed (providing java)
   1. yum satisfies java7 with osg-java7-compat, now requires java >= 1:1.7.0
   1. java already satisfied by Oracle (or IBM) package, *done*

---++++ !OpenJDK providing java7 is installed, “new” !OpenJDK becomes available
   1. java7 already satisfied by existing !OpenJDK package, *done*

---++++ !OpenJDK providing java7 is installed, explicitly updating to “new” !OpenJDK
   1. New Java package no longer provides java7, still required by OSG software
   1. yum satisfies java7 with osg-java7-compat, now requires java >= 1:1.7.0
   1. java already satisfied by updated !OpenJDK package, *done*

Same logic goes for the -devel versions.
