---+ OSG Software Component: OSG Info Services

---++ Purpose

OSG Info Services takes data that [[ComponentGIP][GIP]] generates and uploads it to the BDII and RESS servers.  See the [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/InformationServices/OsgInfoServices][OSG Info Services Overview]] for more info about these components.
