---++ Basic Architecture

There are several parts to the overall automated testing infrastructure:

   * *Tests:* Individual test files and functions written in Python
   * *Framework:* The code that supports and runs the individual tests
   * *Platforms:* Test platforms that run the automated tests — currently using VMs at Wisconsin
   * *Aggregator:* Code that compiles results from test runs and reports summary statistics

The tests and their framework come in three parts. The *Driver* is the main script that is invoked to find, run, and report on tests. Ideally, it knows nothing about what the tests do or how they do it; instead, it just knows how to find tests, sequence them, run them, evaluate their outcomes, and report on the results. The *Tests* are intended to be divided into many files (Python modules) and should be small, be relatively independent, and clearly state their requirements. The underlying *Support Library* contains utility functions common to a variety of tests, a means for accessing global state information across tests, and (future work) a means for accessing global test environment information.

---++ Ideas for Future Work

---+++ Framework

   * Improve logging and test-outcome reporting
      * Formal structure for reporting results from each test
      * Ability to blame a component for failures
   * Add sequence and/or dependency metadata, and make the driver sensitive to that data
   * Expand possible test outcomes (e.g., pass, skip-ok, skip-bad, fail, error)
   * Test categories (e.g., client vs. server, light vs. heavy)
   * External file to define test environment (e.g., location of services, client user name and cert)

---+++ Tests

   * Test Fest
   * Java (matching packages)
   * !BeStMan
   * RSV
   * GUMS
   * Whole job execution chain
   * osg-configure
   * Information services (GIP, CEMon)
   * Gratia
   * Other batch systems (Torque, SGE)

---+++ Aggregate Reporting

   * Transfer results from VM to AFS
   * Collector script (to HTML)
   * Email script
   * Packaging / commit to Subversion?

---+++ Platform Coverage

%TABLE{ sort="off" }%
| *Priority* | *OS/EPEL Repo* | *OSG Repo* | *Notes* |
|  3  | Production | Production | Sanity check |
|  1  | Production | Testing | Doing now |
|  2  | Testing | Production | Early warning system |
|  4  | Testing | Testing | |

   * Different top-level installed packages
   * Test on demand (i.e., on release)

---+++ Long Term
   * Support update/upgrade tests
   * Support tests involving multiple machines (requires test environment, test categories)
   * Use osg-test as a post-install step
   * Better process for turning bug fixes into permanent tests

---+++ ITB
   * Run a local ITB site at Wisconsin?
