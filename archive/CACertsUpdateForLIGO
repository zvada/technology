---+ How to give LIGO updated CA certs

*NOTE:* We no longer do this. LIGO gets their certs from the official osg repos now.

This requires an OSG Software Team member who is at the UW-Madison.

We have some native packages specially built for LIGO that we keep in a separate repository for them.
We also put a copy of the CA certs into that repository.
Here are the steps to take whenever the CA certs get updated:

   1. Make sure you are on a RHEL 6 machine.
   1. Download the latest osg-ca-certs (not -compat) RPM from [[http://repo.grid.iu.edu/3.0/el6/osg-release/i386]] to somewhere local. Make sure it's the latest by comparing the version with what =koji list-tagged --latest el6-osg-release osg-ca-certs= gives you. If it isn't, find that build in koji and download the RPM from there, or wait until repo.grid.iu.edu is updated.
   1. Get the keychain drive labeled VDT from the Condor lockbox.
   1. Extract Native_Signing/redhat/rpm-signing.tar.gz from the keychain drive.
   1. Run <code>sign_rpm.sh osg-ca-certs*.rpm</code>. You can find out the passphrase from the file =PASSPHRASE=.
   1. Delete the extracted files.
   1. Copy the RPM into all of the SL6 LIGO repos: /p/vdt/public/html/ligo/rpm/{production,testing}/SL6/{i386,x86_64}
   1. Run /p/vdt/public/html/ligo/rpm/updaterepos-sl6.sh
   1. Put the keychain drive back into the lockbox.
