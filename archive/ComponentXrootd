---+ OSG Software Component: !XRootD

---++ Purpose

[[http://www.xrootd.org][XRootD]] is a hierarchical file-based storage system. It has datanodes that store files, and redirectors that handle requests. A request for a file queries all datanodes to see which, if any, have a copy of the file. The first datanode that responds to the query is asked to serve the file. More complicated configurations are possible; for example, a redirector can query local nodes first, then query a regional or global redirector which in turn queries other site’s redirectors.

---++ Usage

CMS and ATLAS both have preliminary !XRootD networks. For instance, CMS software uses a fallback method to query !XRootD in case of missing files (job would fail anyway, so might as well try !XRootD before crashing out).

---++ Source

!XRootD is developed by a collaboration that includes SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).
