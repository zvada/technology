---+ Proposal — Project 3 — Configuration Compatibility RPM

---++ Requirements

---+++ Concise Statement

Produce an RPM that contains a version of the VDT configuration infrastructure that is compatible with both Pacman installs and RPM installs. Change existing configuration infrastructure as little as possible, but consistent with the goal of minimizing the time to convert each individual configuration script (a separate project).

---+++ Deadline

No specific deadline has been requested.

---+++ Stakeholders

---++ Proposed Scope of Work

Convert all Perl modules and scripts in the Pacman VDT-Core, VDT-Configure-Base, and VDT-Service-Management packages, then package as a single vdt-compat RPM. Specifically:

   * Write a single function, to be used throughout, to decide whether the installation is Pacman or RPM.
   * As needed, conditionalize functions and scripts to have separate code paths for Pacman or RPM.
   * Avoid making functional changes or improvements to existing code, except conditionalization.
   * Avoid changing functionality to make it more RPM-like.
   * Remove or neuter (usually the latter) functionality that is not appropriate for the RPM environment.
   * Incorporate the existing functionality of vdt-compat into the final RPM.

---++ Proposed WBS

*Note:* For our estimates of effort, we are using “FTE weeks” according to Chander’s definition: “1 FTE week (at CS UW-Madison) is the amount of work that can be reasonably completed by 1 person in one week working on one task (at CS UW-Madison). This implicitly covers all the overheads and interrupts that occur in this environment.” Thus, actual calendar time may be greater, if other projects or delays intervene.
