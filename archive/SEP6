---++ Proposed changes in OSG 1.2.10.

This is the list of changes we propose to have in OSG 1.2.10. (That is, these are the differences from OSG 1.2.9.). The primary goals are the updates for XRootd and Bestman, which are needed by ATLAS as soon as possible. If there are delays in the other aspects of the release, they'll be dropped in order to ship the Xrootd and Bestman changes more quickly.

   * Updates to XRootd
      * Improvements to XRootd configuration
      * Ability to run Xrootd with vdt-control as non-root
      * Addition of Xrootd Gratia probes
   * Bestman update from 2.2.1.3.10 to 2.2.1.3.11 or 2.2.1.3.12
   * Update Apache from 2.2.13 to 2.2.15 (for security fixes)
   * Update of !MyProxy from 4.7 to 5.1.
   * Update of !GSIOpenSSH from 4.6 to 5.1.

---++ Schedule
We plan to begin testing OSG 1.2.10 in late week of April or the first week of May and shipping within a week after that.

If you have comments, please let the VDT team know. 

---++ Change log

| *27-April-2010* | Rewrote this SEP. Instead of being primarily about an RSV update, we moved RSV to the next release and put Bestman/Xrootd updates here because they have become higher priority. |
| *09-June-2010* | Removed update of SRM Fermi Client from this release because of complications with Java.  It will be released in an upcoming update. |
