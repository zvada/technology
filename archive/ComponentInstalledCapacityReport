---+ OSG Software Component: !InstalledCapacityReport

---++ Purpose

This is a simple installed capacity report - it reports the installed capacity of sites as published by OIM (the actual capacity).  It works by reading the WLCG installed capacity values published as XML by !MyOSG and summarizes them.

---++ Usage

After installing the !InstalledCapacityReport package, it should be configured with a target email address, and typically a cron entry is made to run and email the report on some schedule.  There is a postinstall message displayed after installing the rpm with instructions for setting this up.

As far as we know, the GOC is the only site that runs it, which is currently configured to send reports to osg-wlcg-reports@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG every Thursday.  Soichi Hayashi been doing the administrative task of installing / updating / configuring this RPM on reports.grid.iu.edu. 

---++ Source

The !InstalledCapacityReport source code is currently located in [[https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/software/InstalledCapacityReport/ the VDT svn repo]].
