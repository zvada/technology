---+ RPM Transition

---++ Summary

As of Summer, 2011, the OSG has decided to move from Pacman packaging to RPM packaging for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. We will add other operating systems later. These documents provide details of this transition. 

A rough timeline:

*Mid-August, 2011*: A subset of the VDT packaged as RPMs will be available for the [[https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?ovw=True&confId=4531][OSG Site Administrators Meeting]], to provide early insight and get feedback on our direction

*December, 2011*: Substantial portions of the VDT (specifically the worker node client, the client, the CE, and VOMS) ready for production
