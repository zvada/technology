---++ Proposed changes in OSG 1.2.12.

As this is written in late June 2010, we are testing the Java 1.6 update to the OSG software stack. (See [[SEP12][SEP 12]]) The question is, "what comes next"? We have up to four releases in parallel progress that we are planning. If developing and testing intersect nicely, they can be released simultaneously, or we can keep them as four separate releases. These releases are:

   1. RSV Update. (See [[SEP10][SEP 10]])
   1. XRootd update. Specifically:
      1. Add Gratia probes for Xrootd
      1. Xrootd configuration changes needed by ATLAS Tier-3s
      1. Update SRM-Client-Fermi update.
      1. Addition of brand-new Bestman-2 package. (This won't replace Bestman, but it is a major new rewrite and it will be released alongside the old Bestman until the community switches to the new one.)
   1. Miscellaneous "other" update
      1. Update to glexec
      1. Update to PRIMA
      1. Fetch-CRL
      1. Improvements to setup.sh to speed it up and greatly reduce load on a CE.
      1. Possibly some minor improvements to vdt-control.
      1. Possibly some minor improvements to the VDT updater
   1. Ability to report from an SE more easily. (Think CEMon + GIP)

---++ Schedule
The XRootd update is being finalized now (as of late June, 2010). The "other" update is also nearly ready. The RSV update will take 1-2 weeks of development time to finish. The SE information update is in progress. 

Depending on when each of these updates are ready we'll do one, two, three, or four updates. We'd like to say precisely what order they'll be ready, but because there is some development and testing to be done, it's hard to state precisely. We also want to ship things as soon as possible. 

In any case, we hope to have all four of these ready and shipped by the end of August.
