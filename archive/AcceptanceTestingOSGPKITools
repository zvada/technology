---++ How to test a fresh install   

   1. Install the pki tools with =yum install osg-pki-tools=
   1. Whenever testing any of the tools, make sure they're run with the =-T= option so that requests are made against the OIM ITB instance.
   1. Sometimes you may need to coordinate your testing with the Operations team. As of writing this, Soichi Hayashi is in charge of oim-itb.grid.iu.edu and can reset it if need be.
