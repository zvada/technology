This page is primarily for the benefit of OSG Software team members who need basic background on the software components included in the OSG Software Stack.

---++ Fetch-CRL

---+++ Background

---+++ Future

EPEL contains both version 2 and version 3 of =fetch-crl=. When OSG Software Release 3 was shipped, the decision was made to stick with =fetch-crl= 2.x, primarily because the Security team had not approved version 3 at that time. Nonetheless, there was interest within the team and from users about upgrading to version 3.

However, on Scientific Linux 6, there is only =fetch-crl= 3, there we *are* using it. Consequently, we are relying on different versions of =fetch-crl= on SL5 and SL6.

Therefore:

   1. The security team should approve fetch-crl 3 soon, so we can switch on SL5 and make it consistent. (Or not, depending on what's decided.)
   1. If we upgrade to =fetch-crl= uniformly, we must update our documentation, which refers only to =fetch-crl= 2.

---++++ Technical Notes

On SL5, =fetch-crl= comes from EPEL in two forms:

   * =fetch-crl=, which is version 2
   * =fetch-crl3=, which is version 3

That is, both versions are provided, but are named differently.

On SL6, =fetch-crl= refers to version 3, and there is no version 2 available. Thus, “Fetch-CRL, version 3” has different package names in SL5 and SL6.
