---+ Gratia Probe RPM Testing

This page documents the testing procedure to test the gratia probes sufficiently tested to be promoted to the osg-testing repository.  The test procedure is the same on both SL5 and SL6.

   * install or update the =gratia-probe-condor= rpm as appropriate
   * On each VM download the gratia-probe-setup.sh script and run it
   * In =/etc/gratia/condor/ProbeConfig=, verify the following have been changed:
      * change =SiteName= to something aside from =Generic Site=
      * change =EnableProbe= to 1
      * change =CollectorHost=, =SSLHost=, and =SSLRegistrationHost= to the an invalid host (E.g. test.com) or the localhost
   * Create =/var/lib/osg/= and download the attached =user-vo-map= file and place it in that directory
   * Edit the =user-vo-map= file and change the account from =sthapa= to the account you'll be using to submit the condor jobs in the following step
   * Download and submit the attached condor_submit file (note, on the default fermicloud VM, this takes about 3 hours, so you may want to set =NUM_CPUS= to 50 so that 50 jobs will run at a time)
   * Run =/usr/share/gratia/condor/condor_meter=
   * Check =/var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/= for a =subdir.condor_...= directory and verify that there are 200 xml jobs and the cpus/wall times are appropriate (either PT0S or PT1M).
