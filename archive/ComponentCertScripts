---+ OSG Software Component: Certificate Scripts

---++ Purpose

The Certificate Scripts are a set of scripts that provide a command-line interface to the OSG PKI.

---++ Usage

The certificate scripts are typically installed into /usr/bin and used by Grid Admins and others who need host certificates.

---++ History

This component represents an evolution of the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/viewfile/Security/CSReadMe][certificate scripts inherited from PPDG]].

The original OSG PKI Tools code was written at Indiana University under the lead of Von Welch; developers included Rohan Mathure and Viplav Khadke. The code was transitioned to the OSG Software team.
