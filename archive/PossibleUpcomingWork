---+ Possible Upcoming Work

These are ideas for possible upcoming work. The work is not scheduled yet and there may not be tickets for the work yet. It's a place to collect ideas that may turn into projects.

   * Support for SHA-2
   * Add support for Scientific Linux 6. CMS requests this by the end of February. 
   * Add support for CREAM
   * Adding missing packages that were in Pacman-based VDT:
      * [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-439][GUMS]]
      * Gratia Server
      * Squid (appropriate for use with Frontier). It's not clear if there is demand for this. Please holler if you'd like it.
   * Improve internal test infrastructure
      * Begin testing against pre-releases of OSG
      * Expand set of tests
      * Incrementally improve test infrastructure to meet our needs
   * Upgrade software that's behind the curve:
      * New lcg-utils (involves deeper changes due to changes in dependencies that are used)
      * Others?
   * Update to new lcmaps (much better logging)
   * Update to the new glexec
   * Eliminate use of LCAS in lcas-lcmaps-gt4-interface [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-284][SOFTWARE-284]]
   * Validate and release new Gratia Condor probe
   * Non-RPM version of the OSG worker-nod client, so the worker node can be installed as non-root in NFS.
   * Mirror EPEL repositories? 
   * Investigate: can we eliminate the need for shared home directories on the CE?
   * Improve integration testbed:
      * Get glideinWMS factory running for ITB
      * Get !HammerCloud running at UC_ITB
   * Improve usability of OSG Software? (Requires some understanding/investigation/surveys, etc. of where the problems are)
   * Formulate process (manual or automated) of discovering software that might need to be updated
   * Add Pigeon tools
   * Improve handling of Java dependencies (osg-software-tools, Bestman, etc), perhaps via better handling of Maven in Koji.
   * Code review of the build infrastructure (especially =osg-build=)
   * Add cvmfs-client
   * Update to latest HDFS
