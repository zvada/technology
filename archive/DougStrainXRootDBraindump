Build procedure (SRPM+OSG modifications):
- Download SRPMs from xrootd.org.  For instance, http://xrootd.cern.ch/sw/releases/3.3.0-rc3/rpms/source
- Upload to library
- Grab spec file and merge changes into spec files.
  Make sure that the RPM compiles with the "xu" option (stands for xrootd user, as opposed to root user).
- osg-build

Overview:
- xrootd has two daemons on each node:
--  xrootd/cmsd (cluster management daemon)
- In a cluster, nodes act as:
-- redirector (requests go here)
-- data node (data lives here)
- Client Requests for a file => redirector, then redirector queries data nodes for that file.
      [First one to respond] will serve the file  [though selection algorithm can be changed]
      On missing file, redirector waits for all data nodes to return negative or time out.
      In bigger clusters (ie ATLAS/CMS),
            the (site) redirector can query upwards to a regional or global redirector (tree hierarchy)
- Other modules:
  -- xrootd-dsi: gridftp module
  -- xrootd-lcmaps: GSI authentication
  -- xrootd-hdfs: xrootd frontend to talk to underlying Hadoop HDFS instead of local filesystem
  -- xrootd-cmstfc: (osg-contrib) CMS-specific logical to physical file name translation (storage.cfg)

Test procedure:
- Install xrootd using either:
  -- https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallXrootd
  -- or my fermicloud_install.sh xrootd
  -- This tests a one-node install where the node acts as both redirector and data node.
  -- test xrdcp to the node
- Test modules:
- xrootd-dsi: needs external globus-gridftp-server.
  -- Install https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallBestmanXrootdSE
  -- or using ./fermicloud_install.sh bestmanxrootd
- xrootd-lcmaps: GSI authentication (IMPORTANT, was broken in xrootd 3.2.5, 3.2.6, test sl5/6)
  -- https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallXrootd#Security_Option_2_xrootd_lcmaps
  -- or ./fermicloud_install.sh xrootd-lcmaps  [may still need a tweak or two to the script]
- xrootd-hdfs: I usually have Brian Bockelman test this.
- xrootd-cmstfc: This is CMS contributed.
