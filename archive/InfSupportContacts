---+ Infrastructure: Software Support Contacts

This page is about OSG Software email support accounts and how they work, plus a bit about their history.

---++ VDT Support Emails

We maintain various email addresses for support:

   * vdt-support@opensciencegrid.org\
     <p>This is a Fermilab listserv mailing list, owned by Tim Cartwright and with only Ruth Pordes and vdt-support@cs.wisc.edu as subscribers. Ruth (or some Fermilab employee) must be included to have the list hosted at Fermilab. Thus, the only purpose of this list is to forward emails to the Wisconsin address. The address exists primarily for historical reasons.</p>
   * vdt-support@cs.wisc.edu\
     <p>This is an email alias, created and managed by the Computer Systems Lab at Wisconsin (lab@cs.wisc.edu), that simply redirects all mail to [[mailto:goc@opensciencegrid.org][goc@opensciencegrid.org]]. It, too, exists primarily for historical reasons.</p>
   * vdt-discuss@opensciencegrid.org\
     <p>This is a Fermilab listserv mailing list, owned by Tim Cartwright, with (as of December 2013) about 80 subscribers. The list was meant for community support of the old VDT software stack, and in recent times has seen little traffic other than release announcements.</p>

---++ History

Prior to about 2006, email to !vdt-support@cs.wisc.edu went into RUST, the text-based ticket-handling system from the CSL. In very late 2005 or very early 2006, Nate Mueller migrated all of the existing RUST tickets into RT, and fairly soon thereafter, RT became the ticket-tracking system of choice for the VDT. Then we added a second queue, using the !vdt-internal@cs.wisc.edu address. Eventually, the CHTC Infrastructure group (and others?) also started using the RT instance, adding further queues and email addresses. The RT system is lightly documented [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/internal/rt.html][on the VDT website]].

In February 2012, the Software team stopped using RT and instead forwarded to the GOC all vdt-support emails (both domains), which were entered into their Footprints system; the team used the web interface to Footprints to manage support tickets.

In December 2013, Tim received a delivery failure notification for !vdt-support@cs.wisc.edu. Somehow, the account or alias had been lost in the preceding months; no one knows why. The CSL created a new alias with the old name.
