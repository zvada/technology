---+!! Proposal for repository of upcoming software (osg-upcoming)

Underlying ticket: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-883][SW-883]]

%TOC%

---++ Overview

Certain sites have requested new versions of software that would be considered "disruptive" or "experimental" -- upgrading to them would potentially require manual intervention before the site would come back up.
We do not want sites to unwittingly upgrade to these versions.
For the benefit of the sites that do want to upgrade, we want to provide the same assurance of quality and production-readiness that we provide to the software we currently ship now.

Other distributions have typically solved this problem by creating a separate version of our distributions -- for example, Fedora 16 vs. Fedora 17.
If we were to follow suit, we would call it "OSG 3.2."
However, we do not currently have the resources to perform and maintain a full fork of OSG 3.1.
That does not mean that such a fork will never happen.
But for now, we will instead create a separate set of repositories that contain only the "disruptive" versions of the software.

These repositories will be named the =osg-upcoming= repositories.
They will have the same structure as our standard repositories.
For example, there will be an =el5-osg-upcoming-development= repository and an =el5-osg-upcoming-testing= repository.

A full installation of our software stack will _not_ be possible using only the =osg-upcoming= repositories, since they contain a small subset of the software we ship.
Both the main =osg= and the =osg-upcoming= repositories will need to be enabled for the installation to work.
Because of this, interoperability must be maintained between the main =osg= and =osg-upcoming=.

Depending on test results from sites, some packages in =osg-upcoming= may eventually end up in the main =osg= branch.
The rest of the packages will eventually form the nucleus of the next fork of the software stack (e.g. "OSG 3.2").

---++ Process for packaging upcoming software

   1. Put package files in the upcoming software svn area ( =$SVN/native/redhat/upcoming= )
   1. osg-build the package, passing the =--upcoming= flag
   1. Install the osg-release and osg-upcoming-release RPMs
   1. Install and test the new build from osg-upcoming-development (which must be enabled, just as osg-development would)%BR%
      The main osg-* repositories still need to be enabled so the package can get prerequisities.
   1. Use osg-promote to promote the package through the same stages as normal (development &rarr; testing &rarr; prerelease &rarr; release), but use the *-upcoming-* equivalents

It hasn't been decided whether or not "upcoming" should be released in sync with the regular osg releases.

---++ Initial list of software to be placed in upcoming

   * hadoop 2.0
   * java packages rebuilt as part of Java6MigrationDetails

---++ Todo lists


---+++ What to do in Koji

The upcoming repositories will have a tag and target structure parallel to the main osg repositories.
The new tags and targets will be documented in KojiHubSetup.

| *Task* | *Priority* | *Status* | *Time Estimate* |
| Make and document the following tags: =el[56]-osg-upcoming-{release,prerelease,testing,development,build}= | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | %BLUE%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| Make and document the following targets: =el[56]-osg-upcoming= ( =el[56]-osg-upcoming-build -> el[56]-osg-upcoming-development= ) | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | %BLUE%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| Get GOC to use mash on the new tags | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | %BLUE%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | ? |
| Add appropriate policies (ACLs) for various actions on the upcoming tags/targets <sup>1</sup> | %ORANGE%Recommended%ENDCOLOR% | | 2&mdash;4 hours |
   
1. Proposed ACLs:
   * packages in &#42;-upcoming-development can be tagged &#42;-upcoming-testing
   * packages in &#42;-upcoming-testing can be tagged &#42;-upcoming-prerelease
   * packages in &#42;-upcoming-prerelease can be tagged &#42;-upcoming-release
   * allow tagging from &#42;-upcoming-release; to &#42;-osg-testing only.

---+++ What to do in SVN

The directory =$SVN/native/redhat/upcoming= will act as the "trunk" for the upcoming repos: it will not contain the trunk/branches/tags subdirectories, only package directories.
If you wish to create a branch off of =upcoming= to work on a specific project, place it under the =$SVN/native/redhat/branches= directory.

| *Task* | *Priority* | *Status* | *Time Estimate* |
| Make =$SVN/native/redhat/upcoming= and copy or move packages that are going to be in upcoming; document this | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | Needs docs | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| Update =osg-release= rpm with the new repos; document this | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | Needs docs | 1&mdash;2 hours |

---+++ What to do in osg-build

We want to be able to run =osg-build koji --upcoming $pkg= to build both distro versions of a package into the =*-osg-upcoming-development= tags.
We also want to be able to run =osg-promote --upcoming $pkg= to promote a package from =*-osg-upcoming-development= to =*-osg-upcoming-testing=.
If time permits, the osg build tools should prevent the developer from accidentally building an "upcoming" package into the main development tags.

| *Task* | *Priority* | *Status* | *Time Estimate* | 
| Add and document promotion paths to =osg-promote= | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| Add easy way to specify building in upcoming (for example a =--upcoming= flag); document this | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | %BLUE%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | 4&mdash;8 hours |
| Add some way of making sure builds don't use the wrong target by default <sup>1</sup> | %ORANGE%Recommended%ENDCOLOR% | %BLUE%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | 4&mdash;8 hours |

1. This can be done perhaps by selecting target based on SVN branch (unless otherwise specified).
Koji can't automatically do this for us

---+++ What to do in osg-test

We want to be able to test "upcoming" packages in the same way we test normal packages.
We also want to avoid forking =osg-test=.

| *Task* | *Priority* | *Status* | *Time Estimate* | 
| Go through each of our test cases and make sure they handle which version of the software they are testing properly. \
  E.g. do the hadoop tests either work with both 0.20 and 2.0.0 or at least test which one is installed and make the right configs | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;3 days |
| Create and document an =osg-tested-internal= equivalent for packages we test in upcoming; it may be smaller than the original =osg-tested-internal= because we shouldn't have to test components that we've already tested in the regular nightlies and haven't been affected by anything in upcoming | %ORANGE%Recommended%ENDCOLOR% | | 2&mdash;4 hours |
| Add upcoming to our nightlies <sup>1</sup> | %ORANGE%Recommended%ENDCOLOR% | | 4&mdash;8 hours |

1. This doubles the number of tests we run, but currently, our tests take under an hour to run and are given two-hour time-slots, so this is doable.

---+++ What to do in documentation

| *Task* | *Priority* | *Status* | *Time Estimate* | 
| A separate SoftwareTeam.PreReleaseNotes page for packages promoted to upcoming-testing | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| An addition to SoftwareTeam.UpcomingReleases for upcoming changes to upcoming | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| Update to our development instructions, for example SoftwareTeam.RPMDevelopmentGuide, SoftwareTeam.OSGBuildTools, SoftwareTeam.ReleasePolicy, and others | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 4&mdash;8 hours |
| Instructions on how to enable the upcoming repos that can be included in instructions for specific software much like Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories currently is | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| Instructions for specific software that we place in upcoming, e.g. hadoop-2.0.0; these should also contain migration instructions if possible | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | ? |
