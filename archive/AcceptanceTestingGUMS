If you're testing on a fermicloud VM, be sure to set the owner/group of your httpcert/httpkey to tomcat:tomcat, then restart tomcat:

<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown -R tomcat:tomcat /etc/grid-security/http
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown -R tomcat:tomcat /etc/cloud-security/http
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service tomcat6 restart %RED%# If on EL6%ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service tomcat5 restart %RED%# If on EL5%ENDCOLOR%</pre>

---++ How to test a fresh install 

---+++ Web Interface

The web interface should be accessible via https://%RED%hostname%ENDCOLOR%:8443/gums, where %RED%hostname%ENDCOLOR% is the hostname of the machine you installed GUMS on. 

---++++ Updating VO Members

First check to make sure that your VOMS Servers list is populated ('VOMS Servers' link in the sidebar). There should be about 50 VOMS servers listed.

To add VO members to the GUMS database, click on the "Update VO Members" link in the sidebar and then click the "update VO members button". You're bound to get a few Timeout and SSL errors; these are often VOMS server-side issues and can be ignored.
