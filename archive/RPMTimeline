---+ RPM Transition Plan

[[#CurrentState][Jump to the current state]] (Skip the background information)

---++ Goal

Our goal is to provide the following _functional units_ as RPMs for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Scientific Linux 5, and !CentOS 5 by December 13, 2011:

   * glexec
   * Worker Node Client
   * Client (i.e. worker node client + end-user tools)
   * Compute Element (CE)
   * RSV (Earlier discussions included this in the CE, but we've separated it.)
   * !BeStMan, Hadoop & !BeStMan, Xrootd & !BeStMan (SE)
   

This does not account for everything in the existing Pacman-based VDT. Additional functional units will come in early 2012, the time to be determined:
   * GUMS
   * Gratia Collector

In addition to the above functional units, we have two more major areas of focus that cut across all of the functional units and need attention beyond that in the developing the functional units.

   * Internal testing infrastructure
   * Documentation

---++ Release Process 

For each functional unit in the VDT, we will proceed through a series of steps, shown here. Steps 4a, 4b, and 4c can be performed in parallel. 

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/rpm-package-process.png" alt="rpm-package-process.png"/>

The tables below show when we complete each step--they are milestones, not periods of time for each state. 

---+++ Definition of steps
*1. Package* <br>
This is the time where we will construct the set of RPMs for the given functional unit. *Note:* We expect some very basic documentation at this point.

*2. Internal Testing* <br>
This is the time where we do basic, hands-on developer testing of the RPMs.

*3. Fix known problems* <br>
We are allocating time to fix problems. While it is hard to know what problems we will encounter, we recognize that we will make an educated guess so that when we run into the inevitable problems, fixing them fits into our schedule. 

*4a. Documentation* <br>
This is the time when we move the existing basic documentation to something that fits into our documentation structure and is usable by end-users.

*4b. Evaluation* <br>
We might do an extensive internal evaluation for scalability or readiness. For instance, evaluating the scalability of GRAM 5. Not all functional components will need this.

*4c. External Beta Testing* <br>
We will work with one or two selected external sites to do testing. This is outside the ITB testing: we will work closely with them to get early feedback. 

*4d. Trash/Trash/Integration Testbed* <br>
Testing by the integration testbed. 

*5. Limited Release* <br>
We release the software into production. We do not widely announce it, and our ability to provide support is limited (but available). This is a release meant for early adopters.

*6. General Release* <br>
We release the software into production. We announce and fully support the previously created limited release.

---+++ States
Steps can be in five different states:

<table>
<tr><td>%NOT_STARTED%</td><td>Neither started,  nor expected to be started</td></tr>
<tr><td>%ON_TRACK%</td><td>Progress is being made, no worries about meeting deadline</td></tr>
<tr><td>%BEHIND%</td><td>Behind schedule, but may be able to catch up. Not yet at risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>%AT_RISK%</td><td>At risk, deadline may not be met</td></tr>
<tr><td>%ACHIEVED%</td><td>Goal has been achieved</td></tr>
</table>

#CurrentState

---++ Summary as of 13-Dec-2011

| 24-Aug-2011 | Globus 5.2 complications: %TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_DETAILS%}%Globus 5.2 update is underway. As of last week thought we could do a drop-in replacement without rebuilding any packages that depend on Globus, but as of yesterday we learned this is not true. This complicates the push into EPEL. For now we are pushing all of Globus 5.2 and packages we use from EPEL that depends on Globus 5.2 into the VDT. This lets us meet our goals, but reduces full compatibility with the EPEL repository. %ENDTWISTY% |

#WorkerNodeStatus

The worker node client is *ready* for friendly testing and documentation. It is in testing in the ITB as well as at Nebraska and Fermilab Tier 1 ITB. We recently fixed a problem with missing software (LFC Python bindings) found in the ITB. It has been tested with glideinWMS by the evaluation team.

#DocumentationStatus
---++ Documentation

This doesn't match the process diagram above because it is not about packaging but documenting the packages.

Docfest was October 10-12. All the documentation is good enough for our December releases, but we agree that it's still a bit rough. We are likely to have another documentation fest (one or two days long) in January 2012.

#TestingStatus
---++ Automated Trash/Trash/Integration Tests

---+++ State
We have a set of tests running daily and reporting results. We are working on expanding the tests.

---+++ Backround

This doesn’t match the process diagram above because it is not about packaging but testing our packages.

While we have done a lot of testing with Pacman, our system cannot simply be ported to work with RPMs--it is deeply intertwined with Pacman. Some of our existing problems
   * The installation mechanism is entirely different
   * Most of the tests to verify a Pacman installation was sane no longer apply to an RPM installation
   * The testing framework we used does is shaky and ancient
   * The new tests will need to be run in an entirely different way (clean VMs or fresh machine installs)

We trying to balance the need to get some testing as soon as possible with the need to have a coherent system on which to build. The first few steps of this plan get some basic (manual) testing in place without building a comprehensive framework. Because we have significant uncertainty and because we will learn a lot during this time, we explicitly include a planning step at the end of September. At no point will we engineer a massive new system, but we will phase in the testing architecture appropriately.

If the external dependency on the Batlab slips significantly, we will do testing temporarily in !FermiCloud.

#SecurityStatus
---++ Security

In collaboration with the OSG Security Team, we are doing three things:

   1. Making source RPMs for the CA certificate distributions. 
   1. Porting and updating =vdt-update-certs= and =vdt-ca-manage=
   1. Ensuring that the Security Team can maintain the =osg-cert-scripts=. (Previously known as the =ppdg-cert-scripts= and originally maintained by Doug Olson.)

These are not blocking other work because we have a hacked version of the the CA certs that is sufficient for testing purposes. However, it does block releases, so we are trying to get this through testing relatively quickly. Because the packaging was finished ahead of schedule, we have shifted the date from their originals to release earlier. See below. 

The security team owns the planning for this section.

---++ Functional Unit: GUMS
<b><div style="background-color: #CC0000; color:white">DEFERRED TO 2012</b></div><br>

We will package GUMS before the end of the year if possible. This is a low priority goal: we will focus on the CE and exclude GUMS if necessary. For the short-term this is acceptable because GUMS can still be installed via Pacman.
