---+ OSG Software Component: Fetch CRL

---++ Purpose

Fetch CRL retrieves Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for installed trust anchors, that is Certificate Authorities (CAs). A CRL is a list of certificates that were granted by the CA, but have since been revoked. It is good practice to regularly update the CRL list for each CA to ensure that you do not authenticate any certificate that has been revoked.

---++ Usage

---++ Source

[[http://wiki.nikhef.nl/grid/FetchCRL3 Fetch CRL 3]] is maintained by Nikhef.

---++ Packaging

*Repository:* EPEL.

On Scientific Linux 5, =fetch-crl= is available from EPEL in two forms:

   * =fetch-crl=, which is version 2
   * =fetch-crl3=, which is version 3

That is, both versions are provided, but are named differently.

On Scientific Linux 6, =fetch-crl= refers to version 3, and there is no package containing version 2. Thus, “Fetch-CRL, version 3” has different package names in SL5 and SL6.

---++ History

Fetch CRL was developed originally by the European Data Grid (EDG) project. It ran as a daemon, and fetched the CRLs on a daily basis. Starting in (Pacman-based) VDT 1.3.11, it ran as a cron job. [[http://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/util/fetch-crl/ Fetch CRL 2]] was written and maintained by David Groep from the [[http://eugridpma.org/ EUGridPMA]], and was end-of-lifed on 30 June 2012.

[[http://wiki.nikhef.nl/grid/FetchCRL3 Fetch CRL 3]] is a complete rewrite of the tool in Perl.

---++ Future

EPEL contains both version 2 and version 3 of =fetch-crl=. When OSG Software Release 3 was shipped, the decision was made to stick with =fetch-crl= 2.x, primarily because the Security team had not approved version 3 at that time. Nonetheless, there was interest within the team and from users about upgrading to version 3.

However, on Scientific Linux 6, there is only =fetch-crl= 3, and so we *are* using it. Consequently, we are relying on different versions of =fetch-crl= on SL5 and SL6.

Therefore:

   1. The security team should officially sanction Fetch CRL version 3, so we can switch on SL5 and be consistent. (Or not, depending on what's decided.)
   1. If we upgrade to =fetch-crl= uniformly, we must update our documentation, which refers only to =fetch-crl= 2.
