---+ How to Cut a Data Release

%TOC{depth="3"}%

This document details the process for releasing new OSG Data Release version(s). This document does NOT discuss the policy for deciding what goes into a release, which can be found [[SoftwareTeam.ReleasePolicy][here]].

Due to the length of time that this process takes, it is recommended to do the release over three or more days to allow for errors to be corrected and tests to be run.

---++ Requirements

   * User certificate registered with OSG's koji with build and release team privileges 
   * An account on UW CS machines (e.g. library, ingwe) to access UW's AFS
   * Convenience scripts from [[%TOOL_SRC%][GitHub]]
   * =osg-build= scripts in your =PATH= (installed via OSG yum repos or [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-build][source]])

---++ Pick the Version Number

Enter the verions numbers for the OSG version and data revision to be released (e.g. =3.3.12= and =2=, respectively) and click submit:

<form action="https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/HowToCutDataRelease">
Versions: <input type="text" name="versions" size="10" value="%URLPARAM{"versions"}%"/>
Revision: <input type="text" name="revision" size="10" value="%URLPARAM{"revision"}%"/>
<input type="submit"/>
</form>

---++ Day 0: Generate Preliminary Release List

The release manager often needs a tentative list of packages to be released. This is done by finding the package differences between osg-testing and the current release. Run =0-generate-pkg-list= from a machine that has your koji-registered user certificate:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% git clone %TOOL_SRC%.git
%UCL_PROMPT% cd release-tools
%UCL_PROMPT% 0-generate-pkg-list -d %REVISION% %VERSIONS%
</pre>

---++ Day 1: Verify Pre-Release

This section is to be performed 1-2 days before the release (as designated by the release manager) to perform last checks of the release.

Compare the list of packages already in pre-release to the final list for the release put together by the OSG Release Coordinator (who should have updated =release-list= in git). To do this, run the =1-verify-prerelease= script from git:

<pre class='screen'>
%UCL_PROMPT% 1-verify-prerelease %VERSIONS%
</pre>

If there are any discrepancies consult the release manager. You may have to tag packages with the =osg-koji= tool.

---++ Day 2: Pushing the Release

%RED% *NOTE:* %ENDCOLOR% For the second phase of the release, try to complete it earlier in the day rather than later. The GOC would like to send out the release announcement prior to 3 p.m. Eastern time.

---+++ Step 1: Push from pre-release to release

This script moves the packages into release, clones releases into new version-specific release repos, locks the repos and regenerates them. Afterwards, it produces &#42;release-note* files that should be used to update the TWiki release note pages. Clone it from the github repo and run the script:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% 2-create-release -d %REVISION% %VERSIONS%
</pre>

   1. *.txt files are also created and it should be verified that they've been moved to /p/vdt/public/html/release-info/ on UW's AFS.
   1. For each release version, use the =*release-note*= files to update the relevant sections of the release note pages.

---+++ Step 2: Update the Docker WN client

Update the !GitHub repo at [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn][opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn]] using the =update-all= script found in [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn-scripts][opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn-scripts]]. This requires push access to the =opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn= repo.

Instructions for using the script:
<pre class="screen">
git clone git@github.com:opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn-scripts.git
git clone git@github.com:opensciencegrid/docker-osg-wn.git
docker-osg-wn-scripts/update-all docker-osg-wn
cd docker-osg-wn
%RED%# Verify everything looks fine and run the 'git push' command%ENDCOLOR%
%RED%# that 'update-all' should have printed%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

---+++ Step 3: Verify the VO Package and/or CA certificates

Wait for the CA certificates to be propagated to the web server on repo.grid.iu.edu. The repository is checked every 10 minutes for update CA certificates. Then, run the following command to update the VO Package and/or CA certificates in the tarball installations and verify that the version of the VO Package and/or CA certificates match the version that was promoted to release.
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/current/amd64_rhel6/osgrun osg-update-data
%UCL_PROMPT% /p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/current/amd64_rhel7/osgrun osg-update-data
</pre>

---+++ Step 4: Announce the release

The following instructions are meant for the release manager (or interim release manager). If you are not the release manager, let the release manager know that they can announce the release.

   1. The release manager writes the release announcement and send it out. Here is a sample, replace <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">highlighted text</span> with the appropriate values:\
   <pre class="file"><strong>Subject:</strong> Announcing OSG Software version <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">&lt;VERSION(S)&gt;</span></pre> \
   <pre class="file">We are pleased to announce OSG Software version <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">&lt;VERSION(S)&gt;</span>!

This is the new OSG Software distributed via RPMs for:

* Scientific Linux 6 and 7
* !CentOS 6 and 7
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7

This release affects the <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">&lt;SET-OF-METAPACKAGES (client, compute element, etc...)&gt;</span>. Changes include:

* Major change 1
* Major change 2
* Major change 3
