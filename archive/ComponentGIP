---+ OSG Software Component: Generic Information Provider (GIP)

---++ Purpose

The GIP gathers information about the current state of a GRAM Compute Element (CE). This is information such as, “the site is running OSG 3.1.8, uses Condor, has 1000 batch slots of which 959 are in use”. Of course, there is a ton more data than that. You can think of it as describing what a site offers.

---++ Usage

---++ Source

The GIP comes from CMS. Our main contacts for the GIP are Burt Holzman and Tony Tiradani at Fermilab. The GIP is pretty straightforward Python code. Brian B. used to hack on GIP and knows a lot about it.

Note: In mid-December 2014, there was a round of significant changes in the Computing Division at FNAL. It is unclear who will own GIP software going forward. Once that is better understood, this section should be updated.

---++ Packaging

*Repository:* OSG.

---++ History

Designed as a replacement for CEMon. GIP + OSG Info Services is replaced for HTCondor-CE's starting in version 1.6-2.
