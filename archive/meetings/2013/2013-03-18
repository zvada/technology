---++ Notes

*Next release (3.1.16):* Aiming for end of March or early April. Current list of probable features:

   * All LSF-related fixes from the AHM: osg-configure, SEG, jobmanager, Gratia probe
   * Other osg-configure bugfixes
   * Update to osg-ca-certs-updater
   * New release of osg-pki-tools (1.1)
   * New release of osg-ca-scripts with dual RPM/tarball functionality

*Java update:* Preliminary test of HDFS 0.20 suggests that it is OK, but have not tested GridFTP yet. Doug’s scripts are helping — perhaps we should update our documentation with examples from the script.

*Tarball client:* Making good progress; should be ready for alpha testing next week. Still need to test storage clients; Neha and Mat will collaborate to determine who can best do this task.

*SLURM:* Testing at UNL revealed no performance bottlenecks (with a light load). However, jobs were held after execution, so the SEG or jobmanager likely has a bug that we need to address.

*VOMS client:* No news, but we need to get on this task!

*LSF:* Suchandra worked with Horst to fix all known issues for LSF in both osg-configure, lsf.pm, gratia. Very good progress. Changes all work, but need to be committed and added to the release, at which point Horst will reinstall and retest from the packages.
