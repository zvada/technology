| 3.1.23 | 2013-08-26 | 2013-09-03 <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">*</span> | 2013-09-10 | Java 7 builds in 3.1 |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">*</span> Due to the Labor Day federal holiday, the freeze date for 3.1.23 is delayed by one day.

   * Successfully ran GUMS tests in osg-test and added them to nightly runs; need to fix a few small issues
   * Ran osg-test on osg-tested-internal as a VM universe job with only a few failures (CVMFS and !BeStMan 2)
   * Completed initial testing of new osg-test code to test client tarballs (instead of RPMs)

   * Support!

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. <span style="color: #F60;">Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.</span>

   * Java 7: Move packages from Upcoming to 3.1 development &rarr; testing (Mat, Carl, !BrianL)
   * OSG Software 3.2 project: deploy changes for tarball client hosting in ITB (Mat); create new Koji tags (Carl)
   * Finish osg-configure changes, test carefully, and promote (Suchandra)
   * Deprecate CEMon in favor of osg-info-services; little activity until October (Mat)
   * osg-test improvements: get GUMS tests to work consistently, everywhere (!BrianL)
   * Running osg-test in VM universe in CHTC: fix CVMFS and !BeStMan 2 failures (!TimC)

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs: write integration script? (Carl)
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging: turn over packaging/upload process to !TimT (!BrianL)

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Big round of Globus Toolkit updates (waiting for 5.2.5 to be released, then we will submit patches upstream, then wait again for subsequent release)

---+++ Notes

*OSG Next:* !BrianL and Carl will work on scripts and other preparations so that they are largely complete before Mat leaves for vacation (September 17).

*HTCondor Debian:* Might need to rebuild packages to remove contrib modules; maybe !TimT will do this as a way to evaluate documentation.

*HTCondor RPM:* Carl finished the script to create tarball source from HTCondor git; got feedback from !BrianB on how to add it to the automated build. Still need to discuss and resolve questions about number and content of source RPMs.


---++ OSG Release Team

Today is the package freeze for 3.1.23.  By the end of today, we have the definitive list of packages for release.

Normally, we would expect the majority of the tickets to be marked "Ready for Release" by now.  So, major testing effort is needed during this week. Let's have everything marked "Ready for Release" by end of the day on Thursday. So, Brian can thoroughly test the tarballs on Friday. 

---+++ Accomplishments

Testing on HTCondor CE started.  Hope to complete soon.
