%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.24 | 2013-09-09 | 2013-09-16 | 2013-09-24 | osg-configure, frontier-squid in osg-ce|

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. <span style="color: #F60;">Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.</span>

   * OSG Software 3.2 project: wrap up major changes and finish reviews (Mat, Carl, !BrianL)
   * Finish osg-configure changes for 3.1.24 release (Suchandra)
   * Deprecate CEMon in favor of osg-info-services; little activity until October (Mat)
   * osg-test improvements: investigate and fix GUMS upgrade test failures; start coding CA creation in osg-test itself (!BrianL)
   * Running osg-test in VM universe in CHTC: identify and fix !BeStMan 2/!jGlobus/CA cert bug; scalability testing; try creating more base OS images (!TimC)

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs: still waiting for final hand-over (Carl)
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging: turn over packaging/upload process to !TimT (!BrianL)

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Big round of Globus Toolkit updates (waiting for 5.2.5 to be released, then we will submit patches upstream, then wait again for subsequent release)

---+++ Notes

*osg-configure:* The plan is to issue a warning and leave =OSG_SQUID_LOCATION= out of the job environment unless the Squid section is enabled and the location set to a real value. Suchandra plans to have this work complete Monday (today).

*osg-test:* Update test problems for GUMS were resolved when we released 3.1.23, since they were caused by the Java upgrade process. !TimC is working on !jGlobus and GUMS failures in VM universe. We hope to release osg-test 1.3.3 this week and add it to the OSG 3.1.24 release list.

Late Monday, we decided to do a "emergency" release for osg-configure, due to the fact the we introduced a bug and wanted to limit exposure.  (2 GOC tickets already.)  The focus of the release is osg-configure and pulled and missing testing from the 3.1.23 release.  No new rebuilds (except osg-configure), if testing reveals a problem, ticket gets pushed the next release.

Need input from !BrianB on SOFTWARE-1172 to move forward.
