%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.23 | 2013-08-26 | 2013-09-03 | 2013-09-10 | Java 7 builds in 3.1, HTCondor-CE |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

   * OSG Software 3.2 project:
      * Update release process (Mat)
      * Deploy tarball hosting changes (Mat)
      * Document and announce changes (!TimT)
      * Create =osg-release-itb= package (!BrianL)
      * Work on scripts etc. for September and October deployments (Carl, !BrianL, Mat)
   * Debrief osg-configure issues from last week (!TimC, !TimT, Suchandra)
   * Deprecate CEMon in favor of osg-info-services; little activity until October (Mat)
   * osg-test improvements: investigate and fix GUMS upgrade test failures; start coding CA creation in osg-test itself (!BrianL)
   * Running osg-test in VM universe in CHTC: scalability testing; convert to using osg-test configuration file; try creating more base OS images (!TimC)

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs: are we there yet? (Carl)
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging: turn over packaging/upload process to !TimT (!BrianL)

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Big round of Globus Toolkit updates (waiting for 5.2.5 to be released, then we will submit patches upstream, then wait again for subsequent release)

---+++ Notes

*OSG Next:* Carl, !BrianL and Mat need to do scripting for September before Mat leaves.

*osg-test:* We are planning to create a new library for all certificate-related code, which currently lives in the core library, in some tests themselves, and in a separate shell script.

*Test runs on VM universe:* Waiting for HTCondor infrastructure team to provide 6 base OS images.

*HTCondor RPM:* Carl finished script to make source RPM(s) — clean pass-through rebuilds work. Need to meet about how things will work in Batlab automated builds. Carl and !TimT will coordinate passing off this work to flightworthy.

*HTCondor Debian:* !BrianL will meet with !TimT to hand off work and sort out contrib packages.

---+++ Notes

*HTCondor-CE;* Xin is having problems with GUMS. Switched over to using gridmap.  Brian Bockelman thinks the HTCondor-CE is not cause of Xin's problems.  Suchandra to test HTCondor-CE with PBS.

*RSV probes for HTCondor-CE:* Xin will test.

*osg-configure:* Still having problems. Build -42 and code review before release.

*OASIS CAs/CRLs:* Making some progress. Dave Dykstra helping Brian Lin with issues.

*Java 7:* Horst having problems with !BeStMan 2. Neha will help troubleshoot.
