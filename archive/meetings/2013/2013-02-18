---++ Notes

*Release 3.1.15:* Scheduled for March 5, freeze date is March 1. Suchandra will start coordinating ITB testing for tickets that are marked “Ready for Testing”. Minor status updates:
   * LCMAPS/!gLExec: Need to hear from Dave Dykstra to find out if they are ready
   * !GridFTP DSI modules; marked as ready, need to double-check on status then test in ITB
   * osg-make-vomsdir does not need ITB testing
   * Fetch-CRL on track, needs ITB testing
   * osg-build 1.2.5 is ready for testing (Mat will create release ticket)
   * osg-configure changes may be ready; tickets should be targeted for 3.1.15
   * lcg-util: need to test to make sure it doesn't cut off long transfers (SOFTWARE-390)
   * SLURM not on the list for 3.1.15

*Java:* Need to survey *all* builds to identify problems and start thinking about timelines. Most rebuilds are failing immediately, due to ant, so we probably need to fix that before learning much of value.

*Upcoming repository:* Most tasks complete. Need to ask GOC about new repositories and send out a brief description of how to do builds.

*Fetch-CRL:* Need to make changes to packages now so they can be tested. Needs to be done this week. Changes need to be conditional to only be on el5.

*Non-root installs:* Mat to try and cut down Java dependencies; will do this week.

*SLURM:* Some issues at 100 jobs; tested by John at BNL and Suchandra; Suchandra updating qstat script.

*Oklahoma:* Suchandra has more time for Oklahoma this week.
