%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.23 | 2013-08-26 | 2013-09-03 <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">*</span> | 2013-09-10 | !OpenJDK 7? |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">*</span> Due to the Labor Day federal holiday, the freeze date for 3.1.23 is delayed by one day.

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. <span style="color: #F60;">Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.</span>

   * OSG Software 3.2 project: small Subversion change (!TimC), otherwise waiting for soft freeze to start other efforts
   * HTCondor-CE: make some small remaining fixes (!BrianL, !BrianB)
   * Prepare osg-control for initial release: solicit one last round of feedback and tweak as necessary (Carl)
   * SLURM support: Gratia probe configuration via osg-configure (Suchandra)
   * osg-test improvements: get GUMS tests to work, lots of other small improvements (!BrianL); figure out how to create and use own CA (!TimC)
   * Running osg-test in VM universe in CHTC: get jobs to work consistently (!TimC)

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs: complete final tasks (Carl)
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging: submit 8.0.1 build to Debian (!BrianL) (may need to wait for Michael H. to return from vacation, 26 Aug)

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Deprecate CEMon in favor of osg-info-services (Mat, starting ~ 26 Aug)
   * Big round of Globus Toolkit updates (waiting for 5.2.5 to be released (Thursday?), then we will submit patches upstream, then wait again for subsequent release)

---+++ Notes

*Java 7:* Packages will be moved from Upcoming to the 3.1 release series for the 3.1.23 release. Mat will do this task after 31 August and before the hard freeze.

*Unified HTCondor RPM:* Carl and !BrianB got proper builds with standard universe to work! There are a few loose ends to tie up, but otherwise this work is nearly done.
