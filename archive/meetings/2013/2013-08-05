%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.22 | 2013-07-29 | 2013-08-05 | 2013-08-13 | dcache-srmclient, RSV, many bug fixes, CVMFS? |
| 3.1.23 | 2013-08-26 | 2013-09-03 <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">*</span> | 2013-09-10 | |
| 3.1.24 | 2013-09-23 | 2013-09-30 | 2013-10-08 | |
*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">*</span> Due to the Labor Day federal holiday, the freeze date for 3.1.23 is delayed by one day.


---++ Special Discussion: HDFS Extension to Use !XRootD

   * Project summary: If HDFS 2 fails to find a valid file, allow !XRootD to back up the request from its own catalog.
   * Implementation consists of a set of patches to HDFS 2 (just changing access rights on some class members) and a standalone HDFS module.
   * Decisions:
      * Finish testing before contributing to the OSG Software team
      * OSG Software team will accept patches to HDFS, build in upcoming-development, do light testing of packaging and functionality, then promote to upcoming-testing
      * New module package will go into osg-contrib
      * UCSD developers will start trying to communicate with upstream HDFS development community right away, to get advice, buy-in, etc.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Added code to the Gratia HTCondor probe to find and zero-out records with excessive run-time values ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1132 SW-1132]])
   * Updated osg-configure to tell GIP about systems with more than 128GB RAM
   * Made a new version of RSV and wrote test cases
   * Scripted the process for adding the OSG WN client to OASIS
   * Took in contribution of osg-control from Tony Tiradani at Fermi
   * Submitted upstream feature request to fetch-crl developers (want better exit status codes)
   * Validated HTCondor 8.0.1 Release Candidate at UCSD
   * Added osg-test capability to take test-run configuration from a named file
   * Got basic osg-test runs working in a manually started VM guest
   * Updated service certificates on the koji host
   * Submitted the 2013 OSG Security Survey for the OSG Software team
   * Support

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. %RED%Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.%ENDCOLOR%

   * SLURM support (Suchandra): so far, so good … any blockers for release in 3.1.22?
   * OSG Software 3.2 project: finish initial design document and start incorporating feedback (!TimC, Mat)
   * OSG WN client in OASIS: need to deal with CA/CRLs before 3.1.22? documentation; testing (Release) (Mat &rarr; !TimT)
   * osg-test improvements (!BrianL): help Srini finish the Gratia changes and possibly release them; possibly release the configuration file work; get back to GUMS tests, once …
   * GUMS (!BrianL, !JohnH): force GUMS build to use !jGlobus RPM, not its own copy
   * Running osg-test in VM universe in CHTC (!TimC): start experimenting with running in VM universe itself; figure out how to get and use a host certificate

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs (Carl): get feedback on final punch list; work on completing final tasks
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging (!BrianL): follow up with !BrianB and Alan about 8.0.1 build failures on Debian 7

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Big round of Globus Toolkit updates? (waiting for patches to be moved upstream, then subsequent release)
   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure

---+++ Notes

*SLURM:* Everything is nearly ready, except that Suchandra needs to make osg-configure changes so that it can configure Gratia for SLURM; this change will not happen for 3.1.22. Everyone agreed that the SLURM support can ship in 3.1.22, minus the Gratia configuration work, assuming that everything passes testing. For testing, !TimT can contact Burt Holzman directly about GIP/SLURM documentation needs. There will need to be documentation for the Gratia probe, too.

*OSG WN Client in OASIS:* Mat has a script to push the OSG WN Client into OASIS. CA certificate handling work does not need to go into this release. Mat will document the process of pushing client into OASIS in the release procedure, and the Release team will test using the client.

*osg-test and GUMS:* !BrianB suggested adding the GUMS unit tests to osg-test, and everyone agreed that the idea was good.


---++ OSG Release Team

Today is the freeze date for 3.1.22.  Everything intended for the 3.1.22 must be promoted to osg-testing by the end of business today.

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Released OSG "Upcoming Software Repositories Installation Guide"
   * Tested 17 tickets, many more in flight.

---+++ Projects

   * Working on 3.1.22 (41 tickets targeted, 19 Ready for Release, 18 Ready for Testing, 4 In Progress)

   * Document testing expertise on wiki as well as ITB site capabilities.

---+++ Notes

*Testing for 3.1.22:* going well

*GLexec gratia probe:* Neha will test

*HTCondor gratia probe:* Xin will test with help from Suchandra to make sure huge CPU values are zeroed out.

*Gratia SLURM support:* !TimT will coordinate with John Thiltges at UNL.

*GIP integration with SLURM:* !TimT will coordinate with John Thiltges at UNL.

*RSV report for Java implementation:* Xin completed testing on CEs, Suchandra will test on SEs.
