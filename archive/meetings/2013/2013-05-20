---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Completed builds of HDFS 2 and associated packages on all systems, even under Java 7
   * Built OSG package of HTCondor 7.9.6 on EL6
   * Retested many OSG Software components using !DigiCert SHA-2 certificates
   * Fixed the Gratia PBS probe and tested other probe changes
   * Drafted user documentation for doing Java 7 installs from OSG Software
   * Finished the initial list of proposed features for a unified HTCondor RPM
   * Still a lot of effort on long-lasting and challenging GOC tickets

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with Tim to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. %RED%Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.%ENDCOLOR%

   * Migrate from Oracle JDK 6 to !OpenJDK 7: Must complete basic user instructions!
   * HTCondor 7.9: Need working EL5 build
   * HDFS 2: Need working builds soon
   * Remaining fixes to osg-ca-scripts for client tarballs
   * Update OASIS configuration (Dave Dykstra)
   * Update OSG documentation to integrate OASIS (e.g., CE install)
   * Update osg-configure to support OASIS (!BrianB, Suchandra)

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs: Being defined
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure
   * BOSCO (soon-ish, comes along with HTCondor 7.9)

---+++ Notes

Steve Timm is trying to convert 9 CEs to OSG 3 but is having lots of problems with Globus on 3 of them. !BrianB is helping.

*Java migration:* The packages are in osg-upcoming-testing, so we just need user documentation and an announcement. Mat and !TimC are working on it, and the announcement will go out via the GOC as soon as it is ready.

*HTCondor 7.9:* Building fine on EL6, but not on EL5; there are issues with a Boost dependency when compiling the tests. !BrianB suggests disabling building the tests, because we neither run nor ship the tests.

*HDFS 2:* Builds with Java 7. Mat needs to do internal packaging and light functional testing and will likely push it to osg-upcoming-testing this week.

*OSG CA scripts:* Still one bug to fix, but should take only half a day. !BrianL will work this task in whenever there is wait-time on the HTCondor work.

*OASIS:* Dave Dykstra is working on configuration changes; !BrianB will remind him. Configuration changes: Admin would have to update CVMFS configuration. It is unclear whether osg-configure needs to be changed; to see, Suchandra will install and configure OASIS on his ITB site and make note of any configuration changes that osg-configure could handle. On the documentation side, the CE installation and other documents should probably link to whatever OASIS installation or configuration procedures are needed. We need documentation for OASIS itself first — there are no documents targeted at site admins yet. Marco will talk to Suchandra.
Docs targeted at VO admins exist (written by Scott Teige).

*Gratia:* HTCondor and PBS changes should be ready for the next release.

*HTCondor RPM unification:* We have a proposed high-level feature list to share with the community, so Carl will get that posted (talk to !ToddT for location) and announced. Then, Carl will aim for an initial build this week, and a clear list of features that are and are not included. Then we will better understand what remains to accomplish.

*Debian HTCondor package:* On the back burner for the moment.

---++ OSG Release Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Released OSG Software 3.1.18

---+++ Projects

   * Release 3.1.19 (June 4th)
   * Migrate from Oracle JDK 6 to !OpenJDK 7: ITB and other external testing
   * frontier-squid bug fix
   * Test GIP integration with SLURM
   * SLURM: Scalability testing continues
   * !DigiCert SHA-2 testing
   * OASIS documentation

---+++ Notes

*Release 3.1.19:* Targeted for June 4. Will contain Upcoming packages as well.
   * Want to get started on JDK 7 testing as soon as possible.
   * Frontier-Squid bugfix to be in the release.
   * John Hover hasn't responded about testing GIP/SLURM integration yet.
   * Waiting to hear from Derek about BLAHP.

*DigiCert/SHA2 tests:* Suchandra found some !BeStMan errors, which he will investigate, then put it on some production systems and test there. Neha found problems with the Fermi SRM clients. The developer has a new RPM which might fix the problem, but it is a significantly different version and requires (among other things) Java 7. Perhaps a minimal patch might be better than a full new RPM. In general, we need to identify the minimum OSG Software versions that are acceptable for SHA-2 use.

Suchandra will talk to !TimT about ITB testing.

Considering including !GlideinWMS 2.7.1 in 3.1.19. !GlideinWMS 3 should probably go into Upcoming.

!BrianB, !TimC, and !TimC will talk about policy for where to put development series releases.
