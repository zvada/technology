---++ Announcements
Edgar is flying back home to Bogotá, Colombia, as we speak. He will work from there until his visa is approved and he moves to San Diego. Bogotá is in the same timezone as the Eastern United States, so that will make coordinating times, etc., easier.

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.27 / 3.2.1 | 2013-11-25 | 2013-12-02 | 2013-12-10 | Short testing week due to Thanksgiving Holiday |
| 3.1.28 / 3.2.2 | 2013-12-30 | 2013-01-07 | 2013-01-14 | Short testing week due to Holidays |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Work In Progress

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. <span style="color: #F60;">Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.</span>

   * HTCondor-CE and PBS: Jaime Frey found an HTCondor configuration problem; still testing and investigating (Suchandra)
   * Move gridftp-hdfs to Globus: just do it (Mat; [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1214][SW-1214]])
   * Disaster recovery project for OSG infrastructure at UW–Madison: define project and implement stop-gap measures for Koji (!TimC, Mat)
   * Handle empty-* packages better: Move ahead with Plan B (separate repo) and make tickets for actual work (Mat)
   * Automated testing: many tasks defined to finish production workflow (!BrianL, Mat, !TimC)
   * Support HCC and US-ATLAS in Koji: just need HCC signing key to finish their configuration (Mat)
   * UW ITB site: settle on an initial architecture, define tasks for Infrastructure (Mat, et al.)
   * Update Globus Toolkit: investigate library version conflicts; define and schedule update project (Carl, !TimC, Mat)

---+++ Work Upcoming

---+++ Notes

*Java 7 and RHEL 6:* !BrianL and !TimC are seeing consistent and very strange failures on RHEL 6, seemingly due to a re-release of the !OpenJDK 1.7.0.45 packages. We are still investigating. There are no reports of problems from the field, although that may reflect a dearth of RHEL 6 systems (most el6 sites are running Scientific Linux 6), not a problem with our particular environment.

Stemming from last week’s provisioning meeting, Igor and !BrianB (among others) will be working on a document about the architecture(s) of !glideinWMS and !AutoPyFactory.
