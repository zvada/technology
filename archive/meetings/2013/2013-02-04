---++ Notes

*Doug Strain transition:* John Weigand is taking over !glideinWMS. Tim will send out list of things Doug worked on and will take volunteers for things.

*JDK migration:* Tim sent out draft migration plan on Friday to list, to be sent to sites, production team, etc., in the next day or two. Migration will be an all-hands effort. List of packages to be turned into a spreadsheet; people can volunteer which packages they want to take care of; Tim to assign remainder. We are pretty close to getting started on actual work.

*osg-upcoming repositories:* (Internal) draft plan up. Will have a parallel track for osg-upcoming, i.e., development, testing, prerelease, release. Current cross-promotion path is osg-upcoming-release to osg-testing. Will be a parallel branch in SVN for upcoming packages. Java 7 will be done in the upcoming track.

Do we make upcoming releases synchronized with normal release? Also, do we version upcoming? Brian suggests not versioning, and not synchronizing (although still releasing on Tuesday).

*Hadoop 2:* Brian says someone needs to run through documents at least once. Also, environment for xrootd integration needs to be fixed. Other than that, Nebraska has been upgraded and wants to push to other CMS sites. Brian says current tests _should_ work with hadoop 2, although specific package names change; need to assign this task to someone.

*Non-Root installs:* Brian has promised a beta ready by the all-hands. Still need a more detailed plan. Initial design doc to be sent out to osg-software this week; please review.

*SLURM:* osg-configure updated; Documentation should be updated. Also needs scalability testing. Some limited scalability testing should be done before it goes to osg-testing -- at least 2000 jobs submitted to a physical machine.  Suchandra should communicate with Igor and UNL for testing.

*Frontier-squid:* Needs to freeze by Friday.
