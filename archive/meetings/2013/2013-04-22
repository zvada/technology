   * Fixed a SLURM bug
   * Fixed some !XRootD packaging issues that affected HDFS 0.20 (in particular)

---++ Notes

*Release 3.1.17*

   * The Pegasus update is complete
   * The update-install changes to osg-test are complete
   * In testing: !XRootD, VOMS, tarball clients, !GSI-OpenSSH, osg-configure, !jGlobus, !GlideinWMS
      * Testing is nearly complete for !XRootD, VOMS
      * Neha will do some additional testing of voms-proxy-init
      * Suchandra will test !GlideinWMS on his VO frontend
      * TTU found an issue with GSI-OpenSSH, but Suchandra cannot replicate it
      * Some testing of osg-configure is complete, with no problems, but Suchandra will configure his UC site with it
   * On Tuesday, the GOC will create a web download space for the tarballs, from which people should do smoke testing
   * Marco should start writing documentation for tarball clients; Mat and Tim can help
   * Mat will add instructions to the release process for making tarballs
   * ATLAS is requesting extra packages to be added to the clients, but for a variety of reasons, that will not happen this release
   * Gratia probe updates will probably not be included in this release, but we will be flexible on it

*Java 7:* Neha had some problems with a GUMS installation, but it did not reproduce in another installation; perhaps some post-install commands may have gone awry. Neha will continue testing GUMS, then perhaps !BeStMan and the !dCache SRM clients. Carl will finish HDFS testing, then move on to Gratia.

*SLURM:* Suchandra wrote a bug fix last week, and now it needs further internal testing. If that goes well, he will ask Igor to do another round of scalability tests.

*HDFS 2.0:* Mat will resume work on this set of packages this week.
