%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.26 / 3.2.0 | 2013-10-28 | 2013-11-04 | 2013-11-12 | First release of 3.2 series |
| 3.1.27 / 3.2.1 | 2013-11-25 | 2013-12-02 | 2013-12-10 | Short testing week due to Thanksgiving Holiday |
| 3.1.28 / 3.2.2 | 2013-12-30 | 2013-01-07 | 2013-01-14 | Short testing week due to Holidays |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Work Completed

   * Finished preparing OSG 3.2.0 packages for acceptance testing
   * Fixed an OSG PKI tools error message ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1183][SW-1183]])
   * Cut osg-configure 1.0.47 and promoted to testing
   * Cut osg-test 1.4.3 and promoted to testing
   * Moved graphtool package to osg-contrib ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1239][SW-1239]])
   * Finally (!) reproduced the !BeStMan, !GridFTP, !OpenJDK 1.7.0_45 failure on a Fermicloud machine
   * Changed VM universe framework to handle different release series, then added some initial 3.2 tests
   * Started getting Edgar Fajardo integrated into the team and our processes

---+++ Work In Progress

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. <span style="color: #F60;">Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.</span>

   * Debug issues with !BeStMan and !GridFTP and maybe !OpenJDK 1.7.0_45 (!BrianL, !TimC, !BrianB)
   * Switch to osg-info-services in OSG 3.2: made a new minor release, still need to discuss issues with !BrianB this week to reach 1.0 (Mat, !BrianB)
   * !glideinWMS 3.2: planning to release !glideinWMS 3.2.0 in OSG 3.2.0 (pending testing) and 3.2.1 in 3.2.1 (Parag)
   * HTCondor-CE and PBS: still fixing bugs, would like help from FW team (Suchandra)
   * RSV for VOs: restart work this week, albeit slowly; release planned for December (Carl, !BrianB)
   * osg-test improvements: start designing osg-test 2.0 — somewhat on hold while we tackle other stuff (!BrianL, !TimC)
   * Running osg-test in VM universe in CHTC: !BeStMan failures; work on turning into an automated nightly run system (!TimC, Mat)
   * Packaging Doug Thain’s cctools: remove conflicting CHIRP library from HTCondor package, see if condor_chirp is still OK (!BrianL)

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * Waiting for Globus Toolkit update containing our patches

---+++ Notes

   * About 30 packages fail to build from source for 3.2.0. Carl will look into dependency issues.
