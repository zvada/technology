*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">*</span> Due to the Labor Day federal holiday, the freeze date for 3.1.23 is delayed by one day.

---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Finished a set of osg-configure improvements and released to osg-testing as version 1.0.32
   * Finished internal testing of dcache-srmclient
   * Fixed osg-test to work with (old and) new CVMFS 2.1 package
   * Updated the vo-client package with the latest GOC data
   * Support!

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with Tim to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. %RED%Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.%ENDCOLOR%

   * SHA-2: update dcache-srmclient (Fermi) to very new version to support SHA-2 (Mat) — Ready For Testing
   * Update to osg-pki-tools &#8805;1.2.1
   * RSV tasks (Carl, shadowing Mat)
   * SLURM support: Make tickets (Tim, Suchandra, !BrianB), work on them (Suchandra)
   * Running osg-test in VM universe in CHTC (!TimC) — just starting investigative work

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs (Carl): ???
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging (!BrianL)

---+++ Coming Soon

   * OSG Software 3.2 project — definition, tasks, etc.
   * Big round of Globus Toolkit updates? (waiting for patches to be moved upstream, then subsequent release)
   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure

---+++ Notes

*OSG PKI tools:* Mat needs to ping Von et al. to see if they are done making changes to version 1.2.1.

*RSV:* Carl working on small bugfixes and feature additions; he and Mat will make a new release when Carl gets back.

*SLURM:* Two UNL clusters are running SLURM with OSG packages, including Gratia probes. John Thiltges says that they are working; he should talk to Suchandra. SLURM still needs documentation. Also, we need to check on the status of GIP support. Mat needs to make an RPM for the GRAM jobmanager; he will do that this week.

*Automated tests in VM universe:* Our existing test infrastructure is neither flexible nor expandable. !TimC is starting to look into the possibilities of running test runs as VM universe jobs in CHTC. Just starting to gather information, at this time.

*OSG Software 3.2:* !TimC will gather past ideas and define a project for this transition. A corresponding details page will capture specific known tasks and design details. At this time, we hope to include as marquee features in 3.2: HDFS 2, HTCondor 8.0, maybe LCMAPS, and maybe a round of Globus Toolkit updates.

*GlideInWMS:* Version 3.x should probably go into the Upcoming repositories.

*OSG WN client in OASIS:* We should get on this task.
