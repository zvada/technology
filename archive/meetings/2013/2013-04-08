---++ Notes

*!GlideinWMS:* needs a documentation review, and possibly some improvements, before shipping in production. Otherwise, just waiting on some basic internal tests before promoting to testing.

*Client tarballs:* Mat will send out an announcement that they are in beta to osg-int plus 3 people who expressed specific interest. At !BrianB’s suggestion, Tim asked the Security team if they wanted look at the tarballs prior to the release.

*Java:* We completed rebuilds last week, so now we are on round 3 of testing and fixing. At the end of this pass, we plan to call it beta and promote it to upcoming-testing. We will have no shortage of testers; e.g., Oklahoma needs the new Java packages to comply with local policy.

*VOMS client:* It has been built with !BrianB’s patch and just needs promoting and testing. Suchandra will promote it to osg-testing and arrange ITB testing.

*SLURM:* Suchandra found the probable issue and will document and fix it, then send to John at UNL for another round of testing.

*Documentation:* Marco will push on people to complete OSG PKI documentation, and Marco and Tim will review the outstanding documentation tasks, of which there seem to be quite a few.
