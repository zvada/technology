---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Fixed several small issues with osg-configure ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1071 SW-1071]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1092 SW-1092]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1100 SW-1100]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1104 SW-1104]])
   * Tested dcache-srmclient ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1068 SW-1068]])
   * Tested osg-pki-client 1.2.1 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1072 SW-1072]])

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with Tim to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. %RED%Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.%ENDCOLOR%

   * SHA-2: update dcache-srmclient (Fermi) to very new version to support SHA-2 (Mat)
   * RSV tasks (Carl, shadowing Mat)
   * SLURM support: Make tickets (Tim, Suchandra, !BrianB), work on them (Suchandra)

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs (Carl): ???
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging (!BrianL)

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure

---+++ Notes

*dcache-srmclient:* Mat has not been able to test space reservation commands since they do not work against the public !dCache instance, so he has been waiting for access to an instance to test on. However, !BrianB said that we do not use space reservations in OSG. Thus, we can go ahead with this package to osg-testing this week.

There is a general principle here: We need to understand (and document!) our test cases, and they should match usage in the OSG. In this case, the primary users are ATLAS and CMS, though CMS only uses dcache-srmclient as a fallback if lcg-util does not work — so in practice, hardly ever.

*RSV:* Mat gave Carl an overview of RSV source code. Carl started work on a ticket, but no progress last week due to OSG User School.

*SLURM:* Suchandra made a ticket for Mat to create a new Globus GRAM jobmanager package for SLURM. Also needs to talk to John.

*Unified HTCondor RPM:* No progress last week due to OSG User School.

*Automated testing:* !TimC is going to explore HTCondor VM universe, to see if we can run our tests that way on, at least, CHTC. For now, Mat will make client tarball tests run as vanilla HTCondor jobs.

*OpenJDK 7 Testing:* Suchandra running into issues with !GridFTP with Hadoop; he will talk to Carl and Mat about them. This is urgent, because it could affect the release coming up. [Later update: False alarm due to a misconfiguration.]

Mat will add a note to the FAQ on OSG-PKI-Tools about python-simplejson.
