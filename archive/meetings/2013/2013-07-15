*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">*</span> Due to the Labor Day federal holiday, the freeze date for 3.1.23 is delayed by one day.

---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Updated and fixed issues with jGlobus 2 in main and upcoming repositories
   * Built and tested the PBS GRAM jobmanager (with SLURM changes) and found a bug; it is being investigated
   * Re-reviewed Srini’s osg-test work and made some small improvements
   * Tested memory usage in HTCondor 8.0.0 — much lower than in 7.8.x
   * Tested the central manager high-availability code in HTCondor 8.0.1, which had been broken in 7.8 and 8.0.0
   * Support!

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with Tim to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. %RED%Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.%ENDCOLOR%

   * RSV tasks (Carl, shadowing Mat): plan for new release in osg-testing prior to published 30 July date
   * SLURM support (Suchandra): looking into new PBS failures
   * Running osg-test in VM universe in CHTC (!TimC): still compiling notes, suggestions, and a preliminary approach
   * OSG Software 3.2 project: define project this week (!TimC)
   * OSG WN client in OASIS: !TimC and !TimT will define next actions this week

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs (Carl): ???
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging (!BrianL): starting working on 8.0.1

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Big round of Globus Toolkit updates? (waiting for patches to be moved upstream, then subsequent release)
   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure

---+++ Notes

*Tests in VM universe:* !TimC talked to John Hover about !BoxGrinder, but got convinced to run Imagefactory instead. Unfortunately, Imagefactory needs more setup than !BoxGrinder because it runs as a service. Further, the image creation tools may only run in the latest Fedora releases.

*OSG-WN-Client in OASIS:* Mat may be involved the first time through, given his experience creating the tarballs to begin with. But then, the goal is to document the process and make it part of the standard release process.

*Globus updates:* For now, we are waiting for the Globus team to finalize and ship release 5.2.5. Then, we will submit a set of patches against that source code base and wait for them to appear in 5.2.6. After that, we will likely kick off a round of Globus updates in our stack.

*Automated testing:* !BrianL and !TimC have talked about ideas for short-term development. The first significant task will be to add support for a configuration file that can specify *all* inputs to a test run. This will be needed for running (efficiently) in VM universe, so it is good to take care of it now.


---++ OSG Release Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Released 3.1.21 (July 9th)

---+++ Projects

   * Test CVMFS 2.1.11 (What about 2.1.12?)
   * Test BNL stratum 1 in oasis-config (tied to CVMFS??)
   * Test SHA-2 compatibility with dcache-srmclient (Java 6 and OpenJDK 7)
   * osg-configure (5 tickets)
   * osg-pki-tools 1.2.1

   * Documentation

---+++ Notes

*Jglobus*: is at 2.0.4 in upcoming repository, need to be updated to 2.0.5

*oasis-config*: Needs to change to not require CVMFS

*CVMFS*: test on 2.1.12 prerelease, hopefully small testing effort for final release.
