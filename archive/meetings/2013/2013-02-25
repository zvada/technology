---++ Notes

*Release 3.1.15:* Suchandra is writing notes for Fetch CRL testing. Horst and Iwona will test Fetch CRL, maybe also Tony. Horst, maybe Xin to help out for LCMAPS. Iwona testing osg-configure SGE updates.

*Java:* Many packages build, but some packages bring along Java 6 and possibly build with it; we are not worried about this issue for now. To do a test, need to do a normal install, then get rid of other Java implementations, then test. Mat will write up testing instructions. We will not require that sites remove all other versions of Java, but we want to make sure that if they do (which is recommended) then all software works.

*Upcoming:* Mat will send out instructions on how to build into Upcoming and (cf. above) how to test with it. The osg-release RPM in 3.1.15 will make available the repository definitions for Upcoming.

*Fetch CRL:* Marco reviewed documentation; seems complete. Suchandra will be listed as official Tester, but really the ITB testers will test the documentation (as well as the switch itself). Suchandra will ask Xin to help with Fetch CRL testing. Tim will send a notice to sites this week, but the update can be done whenever.

*Non-Root Client:* Mat has a manual proof-of-concept, but it needs scripting. There will be two scripts: one for us (to create the non-root tarballs) and a post-install script for the user. Also in the tarballs will be a shell script to be sourced before using any client tools. Marco has a few tricks from BOSCO which might let us avoid that.

*SLURM:* Suchandra still debugging qstat problem, need to get back to John at UNL about it. Suchandra writing a replacement script for qstat that caches results; can pass this off to John and Igor within a few days. Target number of jobs is 2000–2500, currently the sites die after 100. If this is taking too long (i.e., will not get done by early April) then we might put it into Upcoming first. PNNL has 100–1000 grid slots, so if we can support 1000, then we might be able to push an early production release that they can play with.

*Oklahoma:* Suchandra is still debugging. Note that Horst may be slow to respond due to the snowstorm going through that area.
