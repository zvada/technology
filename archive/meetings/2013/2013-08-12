%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.22 | %SILVER%2013-07-29%ENDCOLOR% | %SILVER%2013-08-05%ENDCOLOR% | 2013-08-13 | dcache-srmclient, !OpenJDK 7, RSV, CVMFS, SLURM support, many bug fixes |
| 3.1.23 | 2013-08-26 | 2013-09-03 <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">*</span> | 2013-09-10 | |
| 3.1.24 | 2013-09-23 | 2013-09-30 | 2013-10-08 | |
*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">*</span> Due to the Labor Day federal holiday, the freeze date for 3.1.23 is delayed by one day.


---++ Special Discussion: HDFS Extension to Use !XRootD

*Project summary:* If HDFS 2 fails to find a valid file, allow !XRootD to back up the request from its own catalog. Jeff and Matevs talked to HDFS developers last week, learning that HDFS may change in the desired way, but certainly not for quite some time. So, we will proceed with the plan from last week: The UCSD team will finish testing, then Jeff will create a JIRA Software ticket for the HDFS patch, which the Software team will incorporate and promote. Jeff and co. will package the extra contrib module, which Software will review and promote.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Drafted and reviewed (in Madison) the technical design document for OSG “Next” (i.e., 3.2)
   * Added the OSG WN client (3.1.21) to OASIS, documented the process, and prepared the Release team to take over future releases
   * Released Tony Tiradani’s contributed =osg-control= script into beta testing ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-607][SW-607]])
   * Tweaked osg-configure to report Tomcat major version correctly (related to [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-607][SW-607]])
   * Built the latest Gratia service with Java 7 and completed some basic testing
   * Tested a new HTCondor feature to make negotiation of glideins much faster ([[https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3585][GitTrac 3585]])
   * Helped Srini at Fermi fix problems with his Gratia tests
   * Worked on the automated GUMS tests; made some progress but mappings still do not work correctly; getting help from John Hover at BNL
   * Evaluated old VDT testing machines in Madison and started process to remove or repurpose each machine

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. <span style="color: #F60;">Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.</span>

   * SLURM support (Suchandra): Gratia probe configuration via osg-configure
   * OSG Software 3.2 project: incorporate feedback on design doc and start estimating and scheduling work (!TimC, Mat)
   * OSG WN client in OASIS: everything is ready for 3.1.22
   * osg-test improvements (!BrianL): release Gratia tests; possibly release the configuration file work; get GUMS tests to work
   * Running osg-test in VM universe in CHTC (!TimC): start experimenting with running in VM universe itself; figure out how to get and use a host certificate

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs (Carl): work on completing final tasks
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging (!BrianL): submit 8.0.1 build to Debian (may need to wait for Michael H. to return from vacation, 26 Aug)

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Big round of Globus Toolkit updates (waiting for 5.2.5 to be released, then we will submit patches upstream, then wait again for subsequent release)
   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure

---+++ Notes

*OSG WN client in OASIS:* The ATLAS software stack currently uses a different tool for file transfers than the one provided in the OSG WN client, so ATLAS will be changing their code to use the OSG-provided tool. This will take a long time. If ATLAS needs anything from the Software team in this regard, they will tell us.


---++ OSG Release Team

Tomorrow is the release date for 3.1.22. Culmination of !OpenJDK 7, and SHA2 work.  Also, CVMFS, most of SLURM support.  RSV probes for Java version.  HTCondor CPU time spikes work around in gratia.

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Perform the bulk of the testing for this release despite not having Koji.
   * Tested 20 tickets.

---+++ Projects

   * Working on 3.1.22 (42 tickets targeted, 39 Ready for Release, 2 Ready for Testing, 1 Open)
   * Waiting for gratia server to be promoted into osg-upcoming-testing.
