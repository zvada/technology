### Discussion

None this week  


### Support Update

-   AGLT2 (BrianL): high load on some worker nodes (`ls /tmp hangs`) with some ATLAS jobs using 100% of swap. Happening less frequently now
-   Clemson and UERJ (Mat, BrianL): Uncovered an issue in our HTCondor-CE installation doc (separating the job queue log from SPOOL doesn't work).
    Reverted that documentation for now and we're discussing details with the HTCondor team.
-   GlideinWMS frontends (Edgar): Can't condor\_ssh\_to\_job in OSG jobs, discussing with the HTCondor team.
    This may be due to singularity and/or shared port configuration.
