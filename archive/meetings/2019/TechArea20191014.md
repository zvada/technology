### Discussion

Decided that sending the weekly email on Thursday is fine for the "Ready for Testing" announcements.


## OSG Investigations

-   Simple validation of xrootd-monitoring-collector passed.  
    -   Working now with Bockjoo on production validation.  Step 1 is making a public test collector
    -   Working with Brian (and Frank?) on GRACC changes.
-   Update of GRACC ES, which may require some development changes.  Hopefully updating this week.
-   cvmfs-singularity-sync development for for python3 update.
-   NSF science bucket metadata for GRACC development this week.


### Discussion

Derek will try to tackle the FoS -> NSF bucket mapping for the GRACC this week, or contact BrianL for delegation
