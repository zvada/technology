## OSG Investigations Team

GOC Transition is going to dominate the Investigations Team's time over the next couple of weeks.   I want to give general status of the transitions we are participating in.  So, I will give a couple of states:  

1.  Have not started
2.  In development - Could be provisioning hardware, adapting software, installing software&#x2026;
3.  Ready for testing - In a state where it can be tested by the consumers
4.  Deployed

| Service               | Status            |
|--------------------- |----------------- |
| OIM                   | In Development    |
| OASIS                 | Ready for testing |
| CVMFS                 | Ready for testing |
| Software Repo         | Ready for testing |
| OSG Display           | Ready for testing |
| StashCache Redirector | Ready for testing |
| OSG Collector         | Ready for testing |

Changes:
- OASIS: Development -> Testing.  Installation was completed and starting to move things over.
- CVMFS: Development -> Testing.  Keys where exchanged, so now we can sign repos.
