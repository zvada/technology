-   LCMAPS VOMS  
    -   Anyone know anything about KIT (GermanGrid)?

-   Doc Focus Frenzy III: 2018-03-01, 1PM Central


### Discussion

Derek will investigate KIT contact information


### Support Update

-   ATLAS (BrianL) - HTCondor-CE transitions (BU, OU, UTA). BU/Harvard say that their Slurm pool drains after a Slurm controller failure
-   Nebraska (Derek) - Carl is taking on a lot of the LCMAPS VOMS transition support. Derek will forward support instructions and Brian will assist if necessary
-   Purdue (Derek) - Purdue is having issues with APEL reporting of CPU Duration.  If I had to guess, I would blame PBS, but maybe log format changed and our very outdated PBS probe failed.
-   MWT2 (Suchandra) - transitioning off of LCMAPS VOMS, will talk to Bob Ball about dCache configuration
