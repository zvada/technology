Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release. 


---++ OSG Software Team
---+++ Discussions
Given the timing of the March release cycle (shipping right after the AHM), and the number of tickets flagged for March already, please try to get as many tickets done as early as possible. The release team needs time to do proper testing.

---+++ Support Update

   * BNL (Marian) - !StashCache unresolved issues, troubleshooting and discussion with !XRootD developer suggests there is network misconfiguration, we try get access to Cache host to investigate further
