Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.  


## OSG Software Team

-   [LCMAPS VOMS plugin bug](https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2771): all FQANs are considered instead of the first one. Blocker for June release.
-   Pre-release tests failed due to install/update failures &#x2013; required `osg-koji regen-repo osg-3.4-el{6,7}-prerelease`
-   Need to start transitioning hosted CEs to LCMAPS VOMS plugin this week, after the release
-   RHEL VMU tests working for the time being even though our RHEL subscription ended. Erin rebuilt RHEL7 exec node, working on building RHEL7 VM image using Aaron's subscription
-   Horst completed the edg-mkgridmap -> LCMAPS VOMS transition successfully last week
-   `xrootd-cmstfc` (contrib) fails to build for EL7, need help with CMake to place libs in `/usr/lib64` rather than `/usr/lib/`


### Discussions

None this week  


### Support Update

-   FIT (BrianL) - Investing CE that doesn't appear to be running
