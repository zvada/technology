Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

### Discussions

-   3.4.0 testing strategy: mostly automated testing with strategic manual testing, particularly with Globus-dependent software
-   Edgar training new UCSD staff on OSG basics this week
