Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release. 


---++ OSG Software Team
---+++ Discussions
   * We will not be shipping =condor-8.6.0= in upcoming because of a change to the !ClassAds API without a corresponding change to the library version 
   * Stuck tickets unlikely to make the EOB software freeze today: 
      * [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2512][Migrate transfer limit code from HDFS to generic plugin]] 
      * [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2563][Add the LCMAPS VOMS plugin]] 
   * !BrianL will canvass admins for 1) interest in a site overview tutorial and 2) interest in any other topics for potential talks. The remainder of the time will be relegated to Software Team office hours. 
   * We expect the Madison ITB CE to be up and running by EOB Tuesday, meeting the end of January target of rebuilding our ITB machines 


---+++ Support Update
   * LBL (!BrianL): Investigated submission issues between submit host and CE: missing condor_mapfile necessary to authenticate CE  
   * RAL (!BrianL): CE jobs held due to job router crashing/failing to claim jobs, Jaime is aware of it. They downgraded from 8.5.8 to 8.5.6, tried 8.6.0 and didn't see any crashing 
   * Utah (Derek): Seeing errors that could be their tmpwatch cleaning up jobs before they execute.
