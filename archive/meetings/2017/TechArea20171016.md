| # of tickets | &Delta; | State             |

### Release Schedule

| Name     | Version       | Development Freeze | Package Freeze | Release    | Notes        |
|-------- |------------- |------------------ |-------------- |---------- |------------ |
| November | 3.4.5, 3.3.30 | 2017-10-30         | 2017-11-06     | 2017-11-14 | 5 week cycle |
| December | 3.4.6, 3.3.31 | 2017-11-27         | 2017-12-04     | 2017-12-12 |              |

Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.  


## OSG Software Team

-   Documentation migration remaining items  
    -   SoftwareTeam migrations
    -   Release3 and SoftwareTeam archivals
    -   TWiki migration headers and archive doc deletions
-   Globus EOL: Actively discussing repo destination with EGI and WLCG
-   November release development freeze - 11/30


### Discussions

-   Per-page migration headers are preferred but a per-web migration would be easier
-   We need to search and replace twiki references in software


### Support Update

-   Colorado (BrianL) - BeStMan not accepting RFC-compliant proxies
-   JINR (BrianL) - blahp failures due to some issue with ASCII chars
-   LBNL (BrianL) - issues with the blahp may have been due to misconfiguration
-   Taiwan (BrianL) - idle jobs on CE, likely a basic configuration issue
-   GLOW (Derek, Edgar) - GLOW isn't running on many OSG sites we would expect.  Edgar is leading the investigation.
-   CMS / NERSC (Derek) - Add userspace StashCache for CMS data caching.  Ongoing.


## OSG Release Team

- Tim Theisen will handle the next release if the new procedure is used
