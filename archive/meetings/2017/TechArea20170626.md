### Release Schedule

| Version        | Development Freeze | Package Freeze | Release    | Notes            |
|-------------- |------------------ |-------------- |---------- |---------------- |
| 3.4.1 / 3.3.26 | 2017-06-26         | 2017-07-03     | 2017-07-11 | Independence Day |
| 3.4.2 / 3.3.27 | 2017-07-24         | 2017-07-31     | 2017-08-08 |                  |

Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

### Support Update

-   FIT (BrianL) - Jobs held, passed on troubleshooting doc  
-   TAMU (BrianL) - SAM tests are better with updates to their scheduler config. Jobs submitted to their backend condor are being held with "job not found"
-   UNL (Derek) - Reprocessed Accounting records for whole node jobs.  Pull request for HTCondor-CE (https://github.com/opensciencegrid/htcondor-ce/pull/151) and Gratia-Probes (https://github.com/opensciencegrid/gratia-probe/pull/18)
-   Syracuse & UCSD (Derek) - GPU nodes are starting up.  Small amount of support last week, but this week I expect production use to start, so possibly some user support.
