### Release Schedule

|-------------- |------------------ |-------------- |---------- |---------------- |
| 3.4.1 / 3.3.26 | 2017-06-26         | 2017-07-03     | 2017-07-11 | Independence Day |
| 3.4.2 / 3.3.27 | 2017-07-24         | 2017-07-31     | 2017-08-08 |                  |

Notes: Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The Testing date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.  


## OSG Software Team

-   Dev freeze next Monday
-   Started transitioning hosted CEs to LCMAPS VOMS plugin last week
-   RHEL VMU tests working for the time being even though our RHEL subscription ended. Erin rebuilt RHEL7 exec node, working on building RHEL7 VM image using Aaron's subscription
-   `xrootd-cmstfc` (contrib) fails to build for EL7, need help with CMake to place libs in `/usr/lib64` rather than `/usr/lib/`


### Discussions

None this week  


### Support Update

-   CTSC (BrianL) - Provided rough size estimate of OSG CE packaging
-   FIT (BrianL) - Assisting transition from GRAM to HTCondor-CE
-   TAMU (BrianL) - SAM tests are still getting held with "Job not found"
-   Syracuse (Derek) - Implemented GPU submission on their HTCondor-CE.  Fermilab is creating an entry on the ITB GlideinWMS factories to utilize and test this new GPU capability.  OSG will follow suite once singularity configuration is developed.
-   UCSD (Derek) - Gave some assistance to job route configuration for GPUs.
-   Nebraska (Derek) - Assisted in debugging missing hours in WLCG report.  Turns out that removed jobs were not being accounted correctly.  Also, Multi-CPU jobs and whole node jobs where not being accounted.
