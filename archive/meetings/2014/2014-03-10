---+++ Release Schedule
%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.31 / 3.2.6 | 2014-02-24 | 2014-03-03 | 2014-03-11 | |
| 3.1.32 / 3.2.7 | 2014-03-24 | 2014-03-31 | 2014-04-08 | |
| 3.1.33 / 3.2.8 | 2014-04-28 | 2014-05-05 | 2014-05-13 | |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

   * OSG internal review on Friday
   * Wrap up work on VOMS Admin builds, developer tests, and promotion for April release (Carl)
   * GT 5.2.5 globus-job-manager crashes; Joe B. is working on it, Mat will monitor (Globus, Mat)
   * Help HTCondor developers build HTCondor RPM in Koji (!TimT, Mat)
   * Set up !perfSONAR space in Koji (Mat)
   * HTCondor-CE and PBS: Scalability testing at UCSD? (Edgar)
   * Disaster recovery for OSG/Madison: improvements as background task, contact Scott for offsite backups (Mat)
   * Automated testing:
      * Finish initial HTCondor-CE tests (!BrianL)
      * Enable HTCondor-CE tests in nightlies (!BrianL)
      * Investigate possibility of adding HTCondor policy to identify and force-vacate VMU jobs (!BrianL &rarr; FW)
      * Start design document for osg-test 2.0 (!TimC, !BrianL)
   * UW ITB site (Mat, !TimC)
      * Wait for Infrastructure to rack, build, and properly name machines, new and old; verify machine set-up
      * Learn Puppet
      * Assign initial machine set-up and configuration tasks to team members
   * Document our documentation needs (!TimC)

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * EL7 support (probably a ways off)
   * Many more things … coming soon …

---+++ Notes

*VOMS Admin:* The latest build may have introduced a new problem with its Java dependencies. We need to understand the issue, determine whether the latest patches actually caused the problem(s), and decide whether our published workaround for this case is adequate.

*ITB and Puppet:* Still waiting for Infrastructure to complete basic set-up tasks; we would like them to be done no later than Friday, 21 March. In the meantime, vdt-bastion is a working Puppet master, and the three NAT machines are using it. Feel free to use this system, but keep in mind that you are changing real machines.
