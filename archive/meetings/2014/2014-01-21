*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

   * Updated to Globus 5.2.5, need lots of testing

---+++ Notes

*contrib:* With more contrib packages being submitted, we need to document the policies and procedures for contrib package release.

*contrib:* Jira tickets for contrib packages should have the a "contrib" label.

*Release Procedures:* Need to document procedure for tagging/untagging if the package list changes late in the process.

*Globus 5.2.5:* Need external testers involved as soon as possible. Suchandra will update !GlideIn Factory at the GOC and send GLOW jobs there.

*gridFTP-HDFS:* Need external testers.
