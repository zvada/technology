%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Version*         | *Testing*  | *Freeze*   | *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.2.7 (emergency) | 2014-03-17 | 2014-03-17 | 2014-03-25 |         |
| 3.1.32 / 3.2.8    | 2014-03-24 | 2014-03-31 | 2014-04-08 |         |
| 3.1.33 / 3.2.9    | 2014-04-28 | 2014-05-05 | 2014-05-13 |         |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * EL7 support (probably a ways off)
   * Many more things … coming soon …

---+++ Notes

   * Was able to reproduce globus-gram-job-manager issue
   * OSG internal review went fine; software team focus might be shifted toward users and usability in the future.\
     We might trade reliability for agility in future releases, i.e. pack more into them even if the testing is not as thorough.\
     Marginal software (e.g. lcg-util) we might want to push to EPEL.\
     Too early to act on anything yet though.
