%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Version*         | *Testing*  | *Freeze*   | *Release*  | *Notes* |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Work Completed

---+++ Work In Progress

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. <span style="color: #F60;">Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.</span>

   * Ship HTCondor CE 1.0: will discuss remaining tasks soon; will need rebuild and maybe some tweaks (!TimC, !BrianL)
   * !GridFTP, !GridFTP-HDFS, and UDT: wrapping up !GridFTP and !GridFTP-HDFS configuration (Carl)
   * Package privilege-xacml software for GUMS: fixing dependencies (Edgar)
   * Support Flightworthy builds in OSG Koji: !TimT to test (!TimT, Mat)
   * Support !perfSONAR builds in OSG Koji: waiting for !perfSONAR developers to test (Mat)
   * Puppet: design and implement a *simple* means for people to contribute OSG Puppet modules
   * HTCondor CE and PBS: consider adding a parallel PBS pool at UCSD (Edgar)
   * Disaster recovery for OSG/Madison: improvements as background task, waiting on IU for offsite backups (Mat)
   * Automated testing:
      * Fix latest RHEL 6 failures (!BrianL)
      * Finish initial HTCondor-CE tests: htcondor-ce-trace still in progress (!BrianL)
      * Enable HTCondor-CE and !MyProxy tests in nightlies: working on fixes to make this happen (!BrianL)
      * Start design document for osg-test 2.0 (!TimC, !BrianL)
   * UW ITB site (Mat, !TimC)
      * Learn Puppet (all !ITBers as needed)
      * Hurry up and wait — seeking approval to buy all new hardware (all !ITBers)
   * Document our documentation needs (!TimC)

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * EL7 support (probably a ways off)
   * Many more things … coming soon …

---+++ Notes

*IPv6:* CMS wants to push on this for Tier 2s. New testing matrix. Use basically everything. UNL has tested a bunch of this already informally. Rough deadline for identifying what’s broken: mid-summer; for fixing: much further out, more of a process.
