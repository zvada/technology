%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Code Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| Sep | 3.2.15 / 3.1.39 | 2014-08-25 | 2014-09-02 | 2014-09-09 | Package Freeze bumped due to Labor Day |
| Oct | 3.2.16 / 3.1.40 | 2014-09-29 | 2014-10-06 | 2014-10-14 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * In-Progress:
      * HTCondor-CE rollout: Train continues to gather speed.  I've seen at least a test CE at all WLCG sites except for MWT2 and MIT (and those sites have been contacted OOB).
      * Will try to revisit !GridFTP-HDFS issues this week.
      * UCSD team making progress toward scale tests, but future of these are somewhat fuzzy to Brian.  From the OSG review we got strong feedback that these are important so we'll likely figure out a way for them to continue despite Igor's departure.

   * Upcoming:
      * (Likely) Marian to take over duties from Igor Sfiligoi for WLCG Machine Features task force.  Work remaining still to be determined.
      * (Likely) Start thinking about design of info system for HTCondor-CE.
