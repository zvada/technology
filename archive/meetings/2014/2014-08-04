%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Version*         | *Testing*  | *Freeze*   | *Release*  | *Notes* |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * !AutoPyFactory: Fixes for GLOW including a workaround for a condor_q bug (Jose).
   * !HTCondor-CE:
      * Caltech issues resolved - non-standard HTCondor setup, will work to get osg-configure to "auto detect" this.  Testing in the ITB factory.
      * Fix available for propagating $HOME to jobs; osg-configure will provide $PATH.
   * !HTCondor: Benchmarking !HTCondor 8.3.0 RC (Igor).
   * !OASIS 2.0: Working on packaging and refinements (Jose).
   * Upcoming: RSV probes and scale testing for new OSG network measurement archive.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Work Completed

   * Clarified HTCondor CE installation instructions with more accurate top-level packages
   * Discovered that OSG CE packages did not include HTCondor CE; added HTCondor CE for August release ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1559][SW-1559]])
   * Fixed issues with missing environment variables in HTCondor CE jobs ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1538][SW-1538]])
   * Created packages to support HTCondor CE-only CE installations ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1552][SW-1552]])
   * Built and tested HTCondor CE 1.4
   * Fixed a bugs in new osg-configure features; built and tested 1.0.58 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1550][SW-1550]])
   * Reproduced !GridFTP-HDFS file corruptions; examined source code ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1495][SW-1495]], [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/21825][GOC-21825]])
   * Cut new version of RSV with fixes for HTCondor CE and Gratia; built, tested, and promoted ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1556][SW-1556]])
   * Investigated !XRootD 4 packaging issues and settled on an implementation plan; delayed release until September ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1448][SW-1448]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1561][SW-1561]])
   * Documented status of !PanDA packaging; handed off testing back to ATLAS
   * Regular support and extra HTCondor CE Support (SLAC, BU, !UMich)

   * Investigated and solved an !OpenSSL/Globus issue for SSEC
   * Fixed some EL 7 package signing issues for HCC
