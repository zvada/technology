%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.30 / 3.2.4 | 2014-01-27 | 2014-02-03 | 2014-02-11 | |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Work Completed

   * Updated the !GlideTester code to work correctly with the latest glideinWMS code
   * Improved the script that mirrors our Yum repositories (GOC 18793)
   * Cut RSV 3.7.14 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1359][SW-1359]])
   * Tested installation of !GridSite from EPEL ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1348][SW-1348]])
   * Cut osg-build 1.3.3 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1369][SW-1369]])
   * Updated Madison ITB architecture to reflect reuse of osg-edu and the new machines that Nate ordered
   * Updated the process for creating the tarball client to work with Globus 5.2.5 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1376][SW-1376]])
   * Improved the script that reports transfer-in statistics for VMU runs
   * Added some initial HTCondor-CE tests to osg-test ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1338][SW-1338]])

---+++ Work In Progress

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. <span style="color: #F60;">Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.</span>

   * <span style="color: #f60;">Fire:</span> osg-configure 1.0.49 broke the --enabled-services list, will have new build by noon (Suchandra)
   * HTCondor-CE and PBS: NFS problems solved, still debugging and testing (Suchandra)
   * Disaster recovery project for OSG infrastructure at UW–Madison: test Koji recovery to VM, continue building Koji configuration in Puppet (Mat)
   * Automated testing: Write initial HTCondor-CE tests (!BrianL), start design document for osg-test 2.0 (!TimC, !BrianL)
   * UW ITB site: waiting for new machines, waiting for old machines to be renamed, check machine setup, pick configuration manager, start assigning installs to team members (Mat, !TimC)
   * Document our documentation needs (!TimC)

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * EL7 support (probably a ways off)

---+++ Notes

*Sporadic grid-proxy-init crashes:* Started occurring when !BrianL introduced SHA-2, RFC proxies into osg-test, so it may be related to one of those things. !BrianB will advise !BrianL on how to set up test machines to capture core dumps. In the meantime, the Brians will continue to investigate. But, this is not a fire, because most sites and users are not using grid-proxy-init (voms-proxy-init instead).
