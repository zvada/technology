%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.31 / 3.2.6 | 2014-02-24 | 2014-03-03 | 2014-03-11 | |
| 3.1.32 / 3.2.7 | 2014-03-24 | 2014-03-31 | 2014-04-08 | |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.
