   * HTCondor-CE: See joint update in the Software section of this report.
      * (After meeting) GOC was able to get the condor-ce-collector package working in ITB. Should be on schedule for the October release.
   * !GlideIn Scale Tests:
      * First (idle scaling) and second (max jobs running, single schedd) rounds are done.  More details GlideInScaleTests.
      * Third round (max jobs running, multi-schedds started last Thursday.
         * 50k base line things worked as expected.
         * Working toward 100k; now at 90k.  A few unexplained negotiator deaths (reported to HTCondor team).  Hitting some remote site firewall limits.
   * OASIS 2.0.0 ITB version: not complete.
   * GOC starting to take a closer look at the networking probe.  Started a round of feedback / fixes with Soichi; estimated a week-and-a-half effort.
