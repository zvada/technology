*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Work Completed

   * External
      * Verified that the OSG patches to HTCondor 8.2 are up-to-date and correct for production use
      * Took an unreleased HTCondor 8.2.4 bug fix (to allow interoperability with HTCondor 8.0) and made a patch for OSG HTCondor 8.2.3; built, tested, and promoted ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1661][SW-1661]])
      * Prepared HTCondor 8.2, HTCondor CE, and BLAHP for the move from Upcoming to normal production ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1646][SW-1646]])
      * Released an HTCondor CE update with some tweaks and fixes ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1649][SW-1649]])
      * Released an OSG Configure update with extra features for the CE Collector
      * Tested VOMS Admin with SSLv3 disabled; wrote user procedure for disabling SSLv3 manually ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1644][SW-1644]])
      * Further improved the HTCondor CE troubleshooting and training documents based on observations at the GOC training sessions
      * Finished development of RSV robustness improvements; built, tested, and promoted ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-806][SW-806]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1648][SW-1648]])
      * Tested and promoted gratia-reporting-email updates ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1635][SW-1635]])
      * Debugged HTCondor and HTCondor CE test failures on EL 7

   * Internal
      * Improved the coverage of Yum repositories – especially for update installations – in automated testing
      * Improved configuration and infrastructure for HTCondor CE scalability testing
      * Drafted a set of milestones for the HDFS Healing project
      * Upgraded the Koji client tools on koji-hub to the version with the TLSv1 patch
      * Rewrote most of the offsite backup script to reduce disk usage spikes at the GOC (due to rsync not doing this for us)

---+++ Work In Progress

   * External
      * HTCondor CE
         * HTCondor CE Collector – Phase IIb starting soon (Mat, !BrianB)
         * Scalability tests, esp. max. number (~10K so far) and ramp-up rate (~60–70/min) of concurrently running pilot jobs (Edgar)
         * Finish a draft of an HTCondor CE overview document (!BrianL, !TimC)
         * Monitor and support sites, especially LSF and SGE (!BrianL)
      * RSV !perfSONAR probe: testing recent changes with Soichi (Edgar)
      * EL 7: time to evaluate progress to date and plan next milestone(s) (Mat, !TimC, !BrianB)
      * !XRootD backup of HDFS accesses: scheduling meeting to discuss planning (Jeff, !TimC, !BrianB)
      * OASIS 2: complete draft packaging; OASIS 2 set up at BNL, still working on HTCondor-CE setup (Jose)
      * IPv6: Edgar has VMs ready to try out, !BrianL will test instructions and set-up (Edgar)
      * !PanDA: can we get the server running here and submit one job?; waiting for them on other packages (Carl)
      * Start documenting the state of our documentation (!TimC)

      * UW ITB site: build machines with Puppet! (all)
      * Offsite backups: add some monitoring? (Mat)
      * !HTCondor CE and PBS: setting up about 700 cores with PBS and an !HTCondor CE front-end (Edgar)
      * Checking local backups with Nagios: waiting for help from Aaron (Mat)
      * Move OSG software source code (not packaging) to git(hub): discuss plan and timing (Mat, !TimC)

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * Start design for new test scheduling subsystem (!TimC, !BrianL)
