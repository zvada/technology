*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

      * Random Configure bug fixes (Mat)
      * RSV !perfSONAR probe: testing recent changes with Soichi (Edgar)

      * Start documenting the state of our documentation (!TimC)

   * Internal
      * Koji upgrade: upgrade to EL6 has been tested and should need minimal downtime; upgrading Koji is harder because of database migration (Mat)
      * UW ITB site: build machines with Puppet! (all)
      * Offsite backups: add some monitoring? (Mat)
      * !HTCondor CE and PBS: setting up about 700 cores with PBS and an !HTCondor CE front-end (Edgar)
      * Checking local backups with Nagios: waiting for help from Aaron (Mat)
      * Move OSG software source code (not packaging) to git(hub): discuss plan and timing (Mat, !TimC)

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * Start design for new test scheduling subsystem (!TimC, !BrianL)

---+++ Notes

*HTCondor on EL7:* This build depends on the EL7 build of the BLAHP, which currently fails. The configure script fails to build a simple !ClassAds program, even though the relevant development packages are installed and so forth. No one has looked at the failures in detail yet, but that will happen this week.

*HTCondor CE vs. GRAM:* The Belle VO is having issues with direct submissions to HTCondor CE sites, notably Virginia Tech who are thinking of reverting to a GRAM-only CE (which was having issues earlier). Jeff will send around the ticket and other background information, but in short, we encourage sites to move to or stay at HTCondor CE if at all possible. Eventually, we will drop support for GRAM and so sites and VOs that rely on it may lose connectivity to OSG. We will look at this particular case and see what help we can offer. https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/22303
