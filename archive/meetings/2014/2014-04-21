%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Version*         | *Testing*  | *Freeze*   | *Release*  | *Notes* |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * EL7 support (probably a ways off)
   * !IPv6 evaluation
   * Many more things … coming soon …

---+++ Notes

   * Dave Dykstra & CVMFS: We agreed that Dave can build pre-release versions of CVMFS into the OSG development repository. They will not move into the testing repository until upstream officially releases the package. Dave may email the osg-oasis list with the development build information, for extra testing, because we know that the members of that list are friendly and will not expect production-ready builds from development.
