*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * HTCondor-CE:
      * Working to define a new info service for HTCondor-CE sites.
      * Tried to organize all HTCondor-CE requests to the HTCondor team here: https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=4555.  In particular, tried to incorporate as many ideas as possible from https://www.aglt2.org/wiki/bin/view/AGLT2/CondorCE.
      * Figured out an immediate-term fix for the hostname problem UFlorida has been experiencing.  The fix is HTCondor-CE only and can be done independently from HTCondor.
      * Variety of bugfixes (those mostly listed under software team work).
   * !GlideIn Scale Tests: First level (Idle Scaling is done), Second level (maxing running jobs at schedd) in progress). More details [[http://www.t2.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/Main/GlideinScaleTests2014][GlideInScaleTests]].
   * OASIS 2.0.0 ITB version pushed back a week to this Friday.
   * CVMFS fixes for alien cache will be in the (future) 2.1.20 release.
   * Network data store progressing nicely.  Will be reinstalling a clean system at GOC to go through deployment.
