%TABLE{sort="off"}%

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * GUMS work wrapping up.  Waiting on FNAL for making relevant dCache patches and do testing.
      * No patches for LCMAPS are needed from OSG (NIKHEF agreed to do them).  Have not yet investigated bestman2.
      * Mine is working with WLCG to hammer out the details of allowing sites to use WLCG banning (without involving OSG Ops).
   * Jose has been working closely with Ops to get a development version of OASIS2 working there.
   * HTCondor-CE rollout work continues.  Minor updates to documentation based on issues from Jose; said issues are not 100% understood yet.
