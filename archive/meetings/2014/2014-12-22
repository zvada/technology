*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Code Freeze* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.
