%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Code Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| December | 3.2.18 | 2014-11-24 | 2014-12-01 | 2014-12-09 | |
| January | 3.2.19 | 2014-12-29 | 2015-01-05 | 2015-01-13 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Code Freeze* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---++ OSG Investigations Team

---+++ Scaling Tests
---++++ HTCondor Pool Tests
   * Upgraded CCB and Startds and couple of Schedds to 8.3.2
   * Shared_Port now working at the glidein level.
   * With current setup:
      * ~2 tcp connections at the Collector per running job
      * ~1.2 tcp connections at the CCB per running job
      * 1 tcp connection at the Schedd per running job

---++++ HTCondor CE Tests
   * Still held at ~10k running jobs plateau. The JobRouter knob turned to be a red herrring.

---+++ GUMS scale tests
   * Working with Fermigrid, got a 3x performance improvement in GUMS 1.4.1.
   * This was achieved by caching GUMS logic lookups for 5 seconds and switching from EMI trustmanager to OpenSSL for TLS.
   * The caching is part of the GUMS 1.4.1 release; the switch to OpenSSL will be documented, but not enabled by default (it has too many “gotchas” currently for generic sites).
