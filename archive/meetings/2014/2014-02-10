%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.30 / 3.2.4 | 2014-01-27 | 2014-02-03 | 2014-02-11 | |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Work Completed

   * !BrianB, !TimC, and !TimT met at Fermi and had a productive discussion about future Technology Area work

   * Cut vo-client with v51 data from Soichi ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1372][SW-1372]])

   * Priority on getting osg-configure configuring osg-info-service.
      * Lack of this feature is a barrier to volunteer testing and 3.2 adoption.

---+++ Notes

*gridftp-hdfs:* Problems found during testing. May be dropped from this release.

---++ Extra Topics

*Moving From Subversion to Git:* There is a lot of interest in moving from Subversion to Git, being able to use Github, etc. Fortunately, everyone on the call has experience with git already, so at least that aspect of a transition is easy. Mat will produce an initial design sketch for feedback from the group.

*Effort tracking:* The Software and Release teams will implement a very simple effort tracking system, hopefully by March. All team members will report percentage effort (in the federal reporting sense) for their OSG Software/Release effort, to the nearest 1–5% value, on each weekly status update. The values will be entered into a spreadsheet, summarized, and tracked over time as a way to understand our real effort. This will not be a tool for enforcement, but rather for understanding. There will be a small number of effort categories, to track big-picture effort of the teams. Soon, !TimC will send out a more detailed proposal for feedback, then we will try it out for the rest of February, then we will start implementing it for real in March.
