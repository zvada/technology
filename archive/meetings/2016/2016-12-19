*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions
None this week, other than the aforementioned holiday schedules.

---+++ Support Update

   * Georgia Tech (Carl/BrianL) - Gratia's CVMFS check is hanging. They also plan on adding more nodes to their pool and need assistance.
   * IIT (!BrianL/Marty) - Investigating glideins landing on the incorrect OS (i.e. EL6 when EL7 is requested). Factory Ops does not have route information easily available so it's difficult to troubleshoot routes from their end. It was suggested that the =!RouteName= be added to the glidein ad but this would be incomplete since job routes are susceptible to change, especially during troubleshooting. Perhaps the routing table could be stored as well.
   * Wisconsin (!BrianL) - Spoke with Gonzalo to get !IceCube submit nodes updated after the New Year. Asked Dan Bradley about updating to the latest gratia-probe to test it for us.
   * UFL (!BrianL) - SAM tests failing due to inability to send sandbox, sounds like it's getting removed out from under HTCondor-CE


---++ OSG Release Team
   * January 10th Release - OSG 3.3.20
