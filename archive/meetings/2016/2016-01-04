*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions
   * Should we promote emi-trustmanager to testing for January? !TimT was concerned about the acceptance testing effort that would be needed to retest all Java components, so it was decided to hold off until after the January release next week.
   * !TimC reminded everyone that !TimT may ask for Software team help for acceptance testing, especially given the short deadline and large number of tickets.

---+++ Support Update
No report this week.
