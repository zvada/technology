*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month.

Nothing in particular.

---+++ Support Update
   * AGLT2 (!BrianL) - jobs held due to non-existing route (or more likely, !MaxJobs or !MaxIdleJobs limit reached). Seems fine now
   * Clemson (!BrianL) - Requested that we modify our PBS submit script to accommodate multi-core jobs. Waiting on Xizhou for details on how to do that in PBS Pro
   * MIT (!BrianL) - Saw more glexec errors on nodes and asked Max to look at the logs but once again, no luck getting in touch with him
   * OU (!BrianL) - Investigating why the held job isn't being removed by SYSTEM_PERIODIC_REMOVE; Greg Thain investigating logs
   * UFL (!BrianL) - Had issues with new cert and CILogon, turns out that he missed a condor_mapfile.rpmnew file
   * Utah (Derek/BrianL) - Successfully submitted job via sbatch, will begin on CE work again soon. He may try out HTCondor-CE-Bosco
