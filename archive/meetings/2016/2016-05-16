*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions

*Utah.* (see below) Instead of having them host HTCondor-CE-Bosco themselves, it might be in everyone’s best interests to host it within OSG. !BrianB, !BrianL, and maybe !TimC will discuss this topic very soon and get back to Utah on an approach.

*HTCondor-CE-Bosco.* What would cause us to suggest that a site move from HTCondor-CE-Bosco to HTCondor-CE? One possibility is too many custom routes; HTCondor-CE-Bosco is not meant to be the way to do this. And then, performance — job router gets confused about state; pilots go on hold a lot; the job router is working especially hard.

---+++ Support Update
   * BNL (!BrianL/Derek) - Provided configuration for SLURM walltime configuration
   * Clemson (!BrianL) - Work with Xizhou to provide a patch that would allow for submission of multicore jobs to PBS Pro
   * Florida (!BrianL) - Had issues with new cert and CILogon, turns out that he missed a condor_mapfile.rpmnew file
   * Utah (Derek/BrianL) - Outlined CE-Bosco plan for submitting jobs to their multiple SLURM clusters


---++ OSG Release Team
   * June 14th Release - OSG 3.3.13 and OSG 3.2.39
