*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

We talked about an issue with gfal2 and an ABI-breaking change midstream in EL&nbsp;6 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2255][SW-2255]]). It affected LIGO jobs at Georgia Tech, which they fixed earlier. It still affects LIGO opportunistic jobs at BNL, but that is less of a concern. We will close the JIRA ticket and open a GOC ticket to see if BNL can update.

Edgar asked about RSV support for CREAM and !NorduGrid. It is not there today, but we could add it. HTCondor already supports those scheduler systems, and even though they lack the equivalent of a fork job that should not present real problems for RSV (which is not so time sensitive).

---+++ Support Update
   * Harvard (!BrianL) - Needed assistance with job router configuration
   * Texas Tech (!BrianL) - Ali needs assistance with his CE install/configuration
   * UCR (!BrianL/Jeff) - Need to verify that pilots are running and completing successfully
   * UNESP (!BrianL/Marian) - Troubleshooting jobs not returning output/logs: looks fixed?
   * Utah (!BrianL/Derek) - Created a PBS scratch build for Guy, he has it installed and configured but needs to test it

---+++ Discussion

---++ OSG Investigations Team
   * OASIS: Working toward a March release that has a number of small cleanups.  Particularly, we're moving away from the problematic NAS device and upgrading to CVMFS server 2.2.0.
   * Still figuring out internals of new Gratia v2.  Derek will be working on this.  Jira project is starting to take shape: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC/][GRACC]].  Emails are ready: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC-5
   * New "secure CVMFS" features have been submitted upstream and accepted.  They will be part of new 2.3.0 release, coming soon.  Github Pull Request [[https://github.com/cvmfs/cvmfs/pull/1497][#1497]]
   * HTCondor-CE-Bosco release is moving forward to release with to 3.3.12, despite HTCondor release hurdles.  Tickets: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2187][2187]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2188][2188]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2257][2257]]
   * Gratia support for HTCondor-CE-Bosco done.  Gratia patch has been made ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2257][ticket]]), reviewed, and accepted.  Also, will need to modify osg-configure for new gratia, which is also done: [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-configure/pull/8][#8]]
