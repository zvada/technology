---+++ Discussions

---+++ Support Update
   * Clemson/Florida (!BrianL) - Conflating total mem, physical mem, and virtual mem requests in PBS (https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2260)
   * FIU (!BrianL) - Pilots were failing due to old CRLs (again) then pilots were being held due to =MaxJobs = 128= in their Job Router (https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/29057)
   * Georgia Tech (!BrianL/Dave) - Answered CVMFS questions
   * SLAC (!BrianL/BrianB/Jaime) - Removed routed job results in parent job re-submitting routed job that always fails
   * Stanford (!BrianB/Edgar/BrianL) - Call to resolve churning CE failing to fill pool. Churning was happening due to too low =MaxIdleJobs= in their Job Router config
   * Utah (!BrianL/Derek) - Updates to docs and walking through certificates, edg-mkgridmap, and osg-configure for SLURM
   * Wisconsin (!BrianL/Sarah) - OIM-ITB requests were failing. Restarting the messaging server fixed the issue.

---+++ Discussion

*HTCondor CE BOSCO*: we decided to drop this from the release until the required HTCondor software is released by the HTCondor team.

---++ OSG Investigations Team
   * OASIS: Working toward a March release that has a number of small cleanups.  Particularly, we're moving away from the problematic NAS device and upgrading to CVMFS server 2.2.0.
   * Still figuring out internals of new Gratia v2.  Derek will be working on this.
   * New "secure CVMFS" features have been submitted upstream.  Hope to have these in an April release of CVMFS 2.2.2.
   * HTCondor-CE-Bosco release is moving back to 3.3.12 due to errors with [[https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=5601][Blahp's proxy handling]].  Tickets: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2187][2187]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2188][2188]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2257][2257]]
   * Gratia support for HTCondor-CE-Bosco is ongoing.  Gratia patch has been made ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2257][ticket]]), waiting on review from someone with commit access.  Also, will need to modify osg-configure for new gratia, which is ongoing.
