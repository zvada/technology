| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| October | 3.3.17 | 2016-09-26 | 2016-10-03 | 2016-10-11 | |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions

Most tickets ready for testing. New CA certificates available; they will be part of the release since the proposal to decouple data from the release hasn't been approved yet, or sent to the GOC.

---+++ Support Update

   * Cancer Computer (!BrianL) - Investigating blahp segfault
   * CERN (!BrianB/!BrianL) - permission denied errors writing to =.log= files on their CE when submitting remote vanilla jobs
   * IIT (Derek) - wants to run both EL 6 and EL 7 jobs behind the same BOSCO CE. It's an experimental solution, but if it works out, it may become the preferred solution for this kind of thing.
     Expect to see more sites wanting to run EL 6 and EL 7 jobs as they start to transition.

---++ OSG Release Team
   * October 11th Release - OSG 3.3.17
      * !BrianL is handling the [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SOFTWARE%20AND%20labels%20in%20%283.3.17%29%20ORDER%20BY%20status%20ASC%2C%20priority%20DESC%2C%20assignee%20ASC][October 11th Release]]
