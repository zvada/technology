*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions
Nothing in particular.

---+++ Support Update

   * Cancer Computer (!BrianL) - Investigated gratia-probe-metric CE history errors: they're "expected" so we should drop the history parsing from the metric probe.
   * Central collector (!BrianL/Derek/BrianB) - There are issues with collector2. collector1 is now solely serving collector.opensciencegrid.org
   * Clemson (!BrianL) - Jobs getting held, seemingly because there's too much load on the PBS Pro scheduler. Site is throttling our jobs so I've asked factory ops to do the same. Maybe need to tinker with =GRIDMANAGER_JOB_PROBE_RATE= and/or =GRIDMANAGER_JOB_PROBE_INTERVAL=?
   * Utah (!DerekW) - Seems to be working.  Currently have 2 clusters configured.
   * UERJ (!BrianL) - Successfully submitting jobs, waiting for verification by ITB factory

     opened a ticket for testing their packaging, and writing a wrapper for Condor jobs to use

---+++ Last Week

   * !StashCache: Intermittent failures at UCSD.  Not necessarily because of StashCache.  Cache machine is on a shared host with other services that broke StashCache.
   * Ongoing developent of =stashcp= by !UChicago - great progress on that.
   * GRACC development has been moving forward.  Tanya's reports (the nice HTML ones) are being converted over to use GRACC.

---+++ Ongoing
   * Gratia V2: Derek will be working on this.  Jira project is starting to take shape: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC/][GRACC]].  Project documentation located at https://opensciencegrid.github.io/gracc.
   * !StashCache monitoring and testing has been vastly improved.  Thanks to summer student at !UChicago.  Still ongoing!
