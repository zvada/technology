*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

   * Suchandra troubleshooting !GlideinWMS issue with Parag and Marco

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * Marian was out-of-country last week
   * !StashCache moving forward
   * GRACC moving forward. Better at detecting problems with Gratia probes than Gratia:
     Gratia database contains a lot of duplicates, but GRACC filters these out
   * New stable release of CE View, hoping to get that working at the GOC

---+++ Last Week

   * Still supporting Utah, though that seems to be winding down.  They are in the progress of installing CVMFS
   * Adding new IIT HTCondor-CE-Bosco.  Working through some issues, but making progress.  Have to work on managing expectations.
   * GRACC, !StashCache moving forward.

---+++ Ongoing
   * Gratia V2: Derek will be working on this.  Jira project is starting to take shape: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC/][GRACC]].  Project documentation located at https://opensciencegrid.github.io/gracc.
   * !StashCache monitoring and testing has been vastly improved.  Thanks to summer student at !UChicago.

---++ Other discussion

   * Edgar out for a couple of days due to jellyfish sting. 
     !BrianL needs access to Edgar's sleeper pool for OSG School-related tests;
     Jeff will try to contact Edgar.
