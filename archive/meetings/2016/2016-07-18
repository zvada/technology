*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussions

Few tickets are labeled for 3.3.15. Software Team: please review tickets and identify likely work for this cycle.

BLAHP changes for caching SLURM queries. Some changes went into the release last week, but they did not include the big set of caching changes. Derek talked to Jaime a couple weeks ago, and it sounded like the changes were ready — could we get them into an OSG release (or package) sooner? !TimC will talk to Jaime about it. !TimT: This is included in the blahp in HTCondor's 8.5.6 release: [[https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=5722][Ticket #5722: Cache job status queries in the blahp]]

---+++ Support Update

   * Utah (Derek): Still installing CVMFS. CE is up and running.
   * GA Tech (!BrianL): !GThain said he'd try to look at the !ShadowLogs today. 
   * IIT (Derek, Suchandra): Busy installing CVMFS on the worker nodes.
   * Texas Tech (!BrianL): CE is up and running. There are RSV errors when trying to contact their SE that we're investigating.


---++ OSG Release Team
   * July 12th Release - OSG 3.3.15 and OSG 3.2.41

---+++ Discussion

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * Marian was out-of-country last week
   * !StashCache moving forward
   * GRACC moving forward. Better at detecting problems with Gratia probes than Gratia:
     Gratia database contains a lot of duplicates, but GRACC filters these out
   * New stable release of CE View, hoping to get that working at the GOC

---+++ Last Week

   * Still supporting Utah, though that seems to be winding down.  They are in the progress of installing CVMFS
   * Adding new IIT HTCondor-CE-Bosco.  Working through some issues, but making progress.  Have to work on managing expectations.
   * GRACC, !StashCache moving forward.

---+++ Ongoing
   * Gratia V2: Derek will be working on this.  Jira project is starting to take shape: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC/][GRACC]].  Project documentation located at https://opensciencegrid.github.io/gracc.
   * !StashCache monitoring and testing has been vastly improved.  Thanks to summer student at !UChicago.
