*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions
   * !TimC, !TimT, and Mat will discuss separately data-only releases that are decoupled from the main software releases.

---+++ Support Update

   * Clemson (!BrianL) - Found bug in new blahp that broke PBS job status caching that was causing the timeouts. Some jobs are still getting held because of job throttling on their end.
