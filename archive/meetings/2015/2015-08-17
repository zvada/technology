| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions
   * *Test failures.* Our automated tests have several different kinds of repeated failures, and it has become difficult to remember what each one is and why it still exists. So Brian Lin is going to create [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1996][a JIRA Epic ticket]] to summarize what is known about failure types and to link to specific tickets about fixing some. Once established, Brian will add a link to the Epic ticket in both the email and web test run reports.

---+++ Major Activities
   * Support EL 7 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1541][SW-1541]])
   * Documentation
   * !StashCache ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1815][SW-1815]])
   * HTCondor CE ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1813][SW-1813]])
   * IPv6 evaluation ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1525][SW-1525]])
   * Support, especially Clemson, Florida International (FIU), Georgia Tech

---+++ Notes
   * *ITB: Tracking user jobs.* It turns out that there is no particularly good way of tracking user jobs from a CE (or the pool that it sits in front of). As yet, we have no confirmation that a user job (real or otherwise) has run on the Madison ITB site. Probably the best reporting comes from Gratia on the frontends that work with the factory that uses a site, and yet we have no evidence of user jobs there – no evidence of much of anything, for that matter. Brian B. says that there are changes to !GlideinWMS and/or HTCondor CE that will make reporting from a site easier, but no one knows whether those changes are released yet and how they will work.

   * *ITB: Documentation.* !TimC has discovered that very few people understand how even parts of !GlideinWMS work, and apparent none of them has ever written a conceptual introduction for the masses. !TimC is going to try to work on such a document, so lots of other people may get questions, requests for review, etc.
