*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussed

   * HTCondor 8.3 still breaks HTCondor&nbsp;CE on EL&nbsp;5 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1921][SW-1921]]). !BrianL has gathered and submitted a great deal of debugging information for this problem, but there has been no help from the Flightworthy team lately. !TimC asked whether this problem will be addressed in the HTCondor 8.3 series. !TimT said that he hopes so. Is there a Flightworthy ticket for this issue even? Is anyone on that team assigned to deal with it?

   * After many brainstorming sessions over the years, we still have no concrete plan for dealing with Java dependencies of OSG Software. Mat will write a design document for this problem this week, and then we will open up the discussion to the team.
