---+ OSG Software Team Meeting for 07-Nov-2011

---++ Attending

   * Bockelman, Brian
   * Sharma, Neha
   * Strain, Doug
   * Selmeci, Mat
   * Weichel, Jim

---++ Documentation
For Nov 1 Release - update
   * VOMS ([[Documentation/Release3.InstallVoms][InstallVoms]] and [[Documentation/Release3.UpgradeVomsService][UpgradeVomsService]]) still needs the review and test to be finished.  (Steve said this week)
   * [[Documentation/Release3.UsingWorkerNodeClient][UsingWorkerNodeClient]] client document is done.

CE
   * [[Documentation/Release3.InstallComputeElement][InstallComputeElement]] needs much work.  Alain owns ticket [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-292][SOFTWARE-292]].
   * Also need [[ReleaseDocumentation/.ValidatingComputeElement][Trash.ReleaseDocumentationValidatingComputeElement]] and  [[ReleaseDocumentation/Trash/TroubleshootingComputeElement][Trash/TroubleshootingComputeElement]].  Alain owns tickets [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-296][SOFTWARE-295]] and [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-295][SOFTWARE-295]]
   * Completing [[Documentation/Release3.NavAdminCompute][Compute Navigation]] page would help identify all CE documents we need.  Suchandra owns ticket [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-298][SOFTWARE-298]].

Help docs
   * Jim proposes splitting help into Admin Help and User Help to simplify both.

---++ Testing
   * Globus testing going fine. Tim and Mat performed basic smoke tests.
   * Neha tested RSV probes, seemed to work fine.
   * Doug used globus-gridftp-server with xrootd and dsi, from a fresh install, worked fine. Tim suggested performing an upgrade test. Doug says he can get to this within a couple of days.
   * Once those are done, should be OK to push new Globus to testing.

---++ Other

   * Brian found a serious bug in gratia, but would like independent verification. Mat has voluenteered.
   * Brian provided a patch, and suggests updating our RPM while waiting for upstream to take the patch. However, he would like Tanya to briefly review the patch first.



---++ Status Reports

   * Mat finished up Globus rebuilds, including software that depends on Globus.  Everything's in the osg-development repo. Also finished up conversion of !ReSS RSV probes.

   * Tim spent some time on testing infrastructure. He is still working on cutting a new release of tests--had problem with !GridFTP init script. New test tests !GridFTP transfers, fork job and condor job. Noted that starting/killing Condor occasionally flaky from automated tests.

   * Doug converted the SRM-Client and SRM-Tester RSV probes from wlcg format to brief.  The old RSV infrastructure no longer works, since it assumes a Pacman install-like layout, including $VDT_LOCATION.  Doug tested probes, Bestman, Xrootd. Also did a Hadoop upgrade (copied from the Caltech repository?) and tested it.  On his plate: testing Gratia SE probes, upgrade test on xrootd-dsi, Pigeon tools, more Hadoop tests.  Also, removing unused Java dependencies from Bestman, but he is waiting for Alex Sim to release the Bestman update before starting that.  Brian suggests working on Discovery Tools.

This led into a discussion of how we can determine which .jar files we ship and their versions.
The problem is that many apps, including webapps, ship their own versions of dependencies as opposed to using system libraries.
Furthermore, determining the version of a .jar file is sometimes very difficult.
Brian suggests putting together a spreadsheet of the .jar files we ship and their versions.
Not the best solution, but better than what we have, which is nothing.
Tim suggests having Doug do this for the SE components.

   * Neha did RSV testing. She had a permissions issue on and some other configuration file issues. She is waiting for a fix from Suchandra before doing further RSV testing. Neha also intends to do some SE testing, and a Bestman gateway install on a Fermicloud machine. She reviewed testing infrastructure provided by Tanya.

   * Brian continued to replace Pacman installs with RPM installs. Replaced first production CE with an RPM install. Had an issue with the new version of lcmaps placing more strict requirements on proxies, for which he filed a ticket.  Brian also found very high memory usage in one running instance in the globus job manager--600 megs in the first running instance, but only 50 megs in subsequent instances.

   * Suchandra spent most of his time working on testing at UC_ITB and testing plans in general.  In addition, he's been working on fixes and improvements to osg-configure.  His plans this week are to release osg-configure 0.6.7 with last week's changes and get a pbs based CE up and running.  And finish getting VO test requirements for the CE.

   * Jim - see Documentation.

   * Alex did follow-ups on OSG assessment review for bestman, bestman2 dependency updates, updating sources accomodating dependency updates, and source build/release updates.
