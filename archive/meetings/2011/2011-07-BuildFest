---+++ Primary Goals
   1. Get the OSG Software Team synchronized and working towards our strategy for packaging the OSG Software Stack as RPMs. 
   1. Train members of the team so they are all capable of making RPMs with the VDT's infrastructure
</td>
<td width=50%>
---+++ Secondary Goals
   a. We want to verify the build process, that it makes sense and will work with packaging future versions (e.g. SL6) 
   a. We will discuss the testing process for RPM-based releases.
   a. We will discuss what is needed and how to proceed with updating the documentation
   a. Of course we want to package as much of the VDT as we can. How much is realistic to do during a three day meeting? We'll see.

---++ Expectations
Our move to RPMs is moving very quickly. As such:
   * The agenda for this meeting is rough and will evolve
   * Our technical understanding is not yet complete. We do not have all answers. Some we will decide during this meeting.
