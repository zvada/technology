---++ Globus 5.2

Globus 5.2 is fully ready for testing. The last major blocker was a problem with init scripts, and Mat has fixed that. 

---++ Signed RPMs

All RPMs are now signed. You should notice no different--install as usual.

---++ CA Certificates

no-ca-certs has been replaced by empty-ca-certs to work properly with yum's crazy dependency resolution mechanism. 

---++ State of testing

Mat: Mat did an initial test of the osg-ce and found the init problems. He'll do further testing.

Tim: Tests caught minor problems that have been addressed.

Scot: Our Condor still doesn't work. Alain is working with Globus folks to address the problem. [Update from 20-Sep: problem has been found, deciding on a fix.]

Doug: Haven't tried the new xrootd-dsi, was working on cemon. Will do short smoke test to ensure that xrootd-dsi and GridFTP still work. 

Marco: Haven't tried it yet, will try today.

Suchandra: Did worker node client on Friday: got it installed but from osg-testing. Will try again with osg-development.
