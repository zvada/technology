---++ Documentation

Jim looked through documentation that needs to be released by November 1. VOMS, glexec, worker node client & client. VOMS is pretty good, but needs the review to be finished. Jim will check with Steve. glexec is good. The "install worker node client" is good, but the "using worker node" client document isn't done. Jim will make a ticket. The OSG client is looks complete. 

The CE is the next big item on the list. There's a lot to do here, much of it assigned to Suchandra and Alain. RSV documentation needs work but Scot will be out. Marco will help finish it, and Neha will test it. 

---++ Update on plan for new version of Globus

Last week we talked about the new version of Globus that addresses library versions and 5.0 backwards compatibility. The current plan is:

   1. This weeks release will use the older Globus . (Still Globus 5.2 pre-release, but doesn't include the new library versions of 5.0 backwards compatibility. 
   1. Mat is working on building and testing the new Globus right now. If it all works (including smooth updates) by next Monday (November 7), we'll push this to osg-testing in mid-November and it will go to production with the other scheduled releases at the end of November. If it doesn't work by next Monday, we don't have time to test and ship this year but will ship it in early 2012 instead.

---++ Tomorrow's pending releases

There were no concerns voiced about tomorrow's pending releases. We are planning:

   * VOMS to general release
   * worker node to limited release
   * glexec to limited release
   * client to release

---++ Effort Reporting

Alain circulated the effort tracking spreadsheet to update for October, please send Alain updates within the next 24 hours. 

---++ Status Reports

   * *Alex*: Working on Bestman release, on the right track. Still targeting the first week of December. (Alain: Might not ship to users until January because it needs more extensive testing.) Briefly talked about getting Neha up to speed?
   * *Doug*: Working on documentation and details for storage areas, particularly transitioning HDFS from Jeff and things that Tanya used to do. Have also tested RSV, particularly the new storage probes. The non-critical storage probes need a fair amount of work because they haven't been updated to deal with the new environment. Alain: don't have to have all probes on ship date. 
   * *Igor:  has been testing the worker node client with glexec with !glideinWMS--they work well together now. A few problems were found and fixed. Also been testing new !glideinWMS and finding bugs.  
   * *Jeff*: Done with HDFS, excluding documentation. Last week worked with Doug to transfer knowledge. Has tested upgrading from HDFS 0.20 from CMS, not from HDFS 0.19 from CMS. He will test this, but not for a few weeks. Alain has questions including the HDFS Chronicle: should it be included? Brian and Ashu will own it (as part of their metrics work), so we don't need to worry about it for the HDFS migration. It does not need to be included in the HDFS migration. 
   * *Marco*: Mostly worked on documentation. Also fixed bug in the CRL probe. Roughly 70% effort in recent weeks.
   * *Mat*: Globus transition going okay. Have rebuilt all of Globus, now rebuilding stuff that depends on Globus (about 25% done with those). Will try to finish it up today and get to update testing tomorrow. So far no problems. 
   * *Neha*: Tested the CE install on !FermiCloud, fixed a lot of minor problems in the documents. Testing RSV, but kind of stuck due to bug in osg-configure. She can continue testing even though she had an osg-configure error. Need no more work, Alain will get back to her soon with more tasks.
   * *Scot*: Made new release to osg-testing last week with fixes for problems found by Doug. New Pacman update last week for Java security update. Will be on leave until November 29th. 
   * *Suchandra*: Finishing up testing of new release of osg-configure (fixes Neha's problem and others. The ITB have been going well. Xin has tested ATLAS Panda jobs. Suchandra has Xrootd 3.1 up and running and will talk to Rob to find ATLAS sites to test it. Steve Timm has been doing good test and will do larger scale testing of glexec soon. Last week, the ITB admins were okay with proceeding with this weeks releases.
   * *Terrence*: Last week had a number of problems with the CE. Brian helped find the problem in the nfs lite Condor job manager, and it's working well now. Now doing load testing: running jobs for 24 hours straight, starting this afternoon. Have noticed that the job manager uses a lot of memory. Brian has some ideas and will look into it when the CE is running at load. 
   * *Tim*: Last week Tim mostly focused on a class he's teaching. He's getting back to our testing framework this wek.

---++ 32-bit LFC on 64-bit platofrms. 

Brian asked about 32 bit LFC. Currently we can't install the 32-bit LFC on 64-bit platforms, but ATLAS needs it. There are two outstanding problems that prevent this, and both are being addressed. First, Globus can't install 32 & 64 bit simultaneously. This may be fixed in the new version--Globus is aware of the issue. Second, when mash duplicates the repo from Koji to the GOC, it doesn't put the 32-bit LFC into the x86_64 repo. Mat is patching mash to address this. The first fix won't filter out to users for a couple of weeks, but this does not need to slow the limited release of the worker node.
