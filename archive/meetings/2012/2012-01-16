---+ OSG Software Team Meeting for 16-Jan-2011

January 16th was Martin Luther King Jr. Day, so the meeting was not held. Instead we collected status reports by email, which are below. 

---++ Update to OSG 1.2.26

We need to do a security release for the Pacman-based OSG software. It will fix a [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-484][serious security flaw in Tomcat 5.5]] and it will fix [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-485][a problem with the Gratia PBS probe]].

---+++ Tim
Last week, I worked only 2 days due to illness, and then some of that time was spent on non-OSG tasks.

In any case, I got Condor 7.6.4 rebuilt (to fix its revision string) and into the testing repository.  I am waiting for Condor 7.6.6 to be tagged (hopefully today), and then I will turn the crank on a new release.

I am about ready to start work on the next significant updates to the osg-test software.  There is [[TestingPlans][a TWiki page for the work]] (and associated design ideas):

On a related note, I have been answering a few questions from Maxim about his work on writing UberFTP and gLExec tests.
