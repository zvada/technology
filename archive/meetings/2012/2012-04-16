---++ State of testing

Tim hasn't released new osg-test yet but plans to later this week. We've been testing osg-test from Subversion, which helps. We've also expanded our platform coverage: we now cover osg-release in addition osg-testing. 

---++ State next week's release
Doug says there are lingering issues with OSG HDFS. We missed a package on the first round: gridftp-hdfs. (Looking for library in wrong place.) Doug is fixing that and Mat will help. Doug has tested Bestman on SL6. 

Xin says the testing is going well at BNL. Has been installed on both SL5 and SL6 with jobs through the system and no problems so far. 

---++ Status Reports

   * *Alain*: Training at GOC. He talked to the GOC about putting OSG Software Team members into the MIS VO to aid with site debugging, and they've agreed in principle. We'll work out the details later. As part of the preparation for training, Alain worked hard on troubleshooting documents: you can see them in the Release documentation and should refer to them when helping users. Also, Tony shared his "gsh" tool with Alain, and it _rocks_. It's a wrapper for globus-job-run that lets you easily troubleshoot a CE as long as GRAM works. In combination with gsh, it could really help us debug more problems.
   * *Doug*: Have been testing SL6. So far, so good except for gridftp-hdfs. (See above.) The only issue is with Bestman: started talking to Alex about versioning the new Bestman release. Alex is concerned about non-OSG testing. So there will be a bunch of discussions to sort this out. Alain needs to join conversation with Alex. 
   * *Marco*: Nothing to update right now. Will be working on documentation this week.
   * *Mat*: Got GUMS working on SL6 and did the OSG 3.0.10 release. 
   * *Neha*: Have been working on Bestman, and the tests have been committed. Neha lost her dCache installations on FermiCloud. While annoying, it's also a good time to work on the configuration. 
   * *Terrence*: (By email). Terrence has been testing GUMS are a higher scale (up to 35 requests per second) and it's looking really good. 
   * *Tim*: (By email) "Last week, I had virtually no time to work on OSG Software tasks, including the osg-test package.  Hopefully later this week, I will have more time and be able to release osg-test 1.1."
   * *Xin*: See the ITB testing above. Will work with Jaime on stress tests again.

---++ Question from Tanya about the gratia service
Tanya is building gratia service for SL6. She can build it with rpmbuild, but fails in Koji because it's using the GNU Java. From the description, this sounds like the same problem that Doug is having. Mat will help with it after the meeting
