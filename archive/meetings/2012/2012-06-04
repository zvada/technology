---++ Extending triage duty to include daily test results
Alain proposes that the weekly triage duty now include a daily examination of test results.The triager should holler about any new problems and make sure other people on the team are aware of them. 

Tim said that he's been doing this regularly the last few weeks. He agrees that it shouldn't take much time in the morning, particularly after the first day of triage.

If you want to be on the mailing list for the daily test results, just holler and Alain will help.

---++ Bestman test failures (Neha)

Summarizing the discussion on the mailing list: Neha will work on making sure that Bestman starts up reliably and the related tests consistently pass. [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-677][SOFTWARE-677]]

---++ Plans for OSG Software 3.1.4 and 3.1.5

Alain went over the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/UpcomingReleases][plans for OSG Software 3.1.4 and 3.1.5]]. Basic plan: very small release next Tuesday, bigger release on 26-June-2012. 

---+++ Expanding set of people who can cut releases
Alain would like more people to be capable of cutting releases. Right now only Alain and Mat have experience with it. Because the next release is relatively small, it's a good time for someone else to get up to speed. Alain proposed that Suchandra should cut the next release and Suchandra agreed. Suchandra should work with Mat and should expect to do a few releases to get the hang of it.

---++ Status Reports
   * *Doug*: Have been doing Bestman work. Had to fix !GridFTP HDFS: what appeared to be an RSV !GridFTP problem was actually a problem with the !GridFTP HDFS code, which didn't implement delete. Doug fixed the code and sent the patch to Brian and it needs a code review. We'll add to end of June release. [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-667][SOFTWARE-667]].
   * *Marco*: Has some suggested changes for RSV. Will coordinate with Scot. Can help with documentation tickets. 
   * *Neha*: On vacation last week. Will work on Bestman init script. (see above)
   * *Scot*: Has been working on RSV for the OSG 3.1.5 release. Also spending time on travel logistics for African grid school in Ghana.
   * *Suchandra*: Have been working on PBS/Torque tests. He thinks it's fixed (modulo a Koji tag mistake). Have also address missing osg-configure tests. Next will work on finishing up the !GlideinWMS ITB installation. [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-678][SOFTWARE-678]]
   * *Tim*: Not much to report on software, have been focused on the OSG User School. Focused on getting the tests solid so we can have the new osg-test release. The OSG User School is going well.
   * *Xin*: Have tested the latest release. Found an osg-configure/RSV problem, reported to Suchandra. Will test the new GRAM job manager when Alain sends out details.
