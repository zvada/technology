---++ Status Reports

   * *Doug*: I have been working on fixing some of the issues with Hadoop 2.0.0 and helping out with a few questions and support issues.  I will probably continue doing that this week.
   * *Igor*:  Last week:  Installed and tested the v2_6 frontend, did not find any problems This week: Test the HA capabilities of glideinWMS v2_6 (needed/requested by CMS)
   * *Mat*: Worked on CREAM. The client tools work and the service works enough to be queried but not submit jobs.
   * *Neha*: 
      * Submitted/received digicert request
      * Set up a static ip fermicloud node for SE SHA2 testing
      * Requested/received SHA2 based personal certificate. Forwarded instructions received from Steve to Dmitry so he can get one
      * Troubleshooted failures with gridftp probe as reported http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-69 Fix was trivial but took some time to debug.
      * Looked at new jglobus2. Just started going through Bestman code to see what parts will get affected by the change
   * *Scot*: Grid school in Ghana
   * *Suchandra*:  Last week I worked on some SGE related issues in osg-configure, as well as other tickets that popped up at the goc, and testing gratia condor and pbs probes.  I spent some time sorting out a hardware/os issue with one of the kvm hosting my ITB instances and updating the gratia probes for xrootd and hadoop.  
   * *Tim*: Still not much software time, mostly OSG School wrap-up. Done with my class this week, which should help my availability.
