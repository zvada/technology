---++ Reserved uid's
Alain heard from a user that had made a subtle mistake: he assigned the xrootd user uid 91. This was a bad move because Red Hat assumes that uids less than 500 are theirs to use and uid 91 is reserved for Tomcat. The Tomcat RPM specifically requires uid 91 for the tomcat user, and there are errors if it's not available. 

Y'all should be aware of this when doing support. 

This is not specific to Tomcat. Alain [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/KnownProblems#Reserved_user_ids_especially_for][documented some generalities about this problem]]. He also updated other documentation, such as the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallComputeElement#Users][Install Compute Element]]. 

---++ OSG Software 3.1.7 release. 

We discussed [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/UpcomingReleases][the plans for the OSG Software 3.1.7 release]]. Doug advocated for releasing ASAP due to the xrootd-lcmaps that urgently needs to be fixed, and we agreed to do it in one week, on Tuesday, August 23rd. There are other fixes ready to include.

Brian is concerned about [[http://jira.globus.org/browse/GT-233][GT-233: Gatekeeper log rotation isn' working]]. We don't have a fix yet so it can be scheduled, but Alain agrees it needs to happen soon. 

---++ Trash/Trash/Integration testbed: glideins
Suchandra reports that the ITB factory and glidein frontend are working but the glideins fail due to a glexec error. Hopefully it will all work oon.

---++ Status Reports

   * *Doug*: Working on the HDFS upgrade. It's semi-working. Main issues are with configuration: the Cloudera configuration is empty and we need to help users.  This is a lot of work and there are still many problems to solve. That said, progress is good and it should be done on schedule. 
   * *Igor/UCSD*: Tested glideinWMS RC from the factory point of view; Helped test a Condor pre-release gridmanager that addressed a Nordugrid bug
   * *Marco*: edg-mkgridmap
   * *Mat*: Worked on Condor w/ CREAM and CREAM server. Running into difficulties.
   * *Scot*: Ghana summer school. Pacman builds in new Batlab. Leaving for another job. Last day August 24th. 
   * *Suchandra*: GOC tickets: UFL Gratia issue (Torque 4.0 update) !GridFTP HDFS plugin into 5.2.3. Glidein work (above)
   * *Xin*: ITB site is in good shape. Alain will followup with him to find more work.
