---+ OSG Software Team Meeting, 24 September 2012

*Attending:* Brian, Doug, Marco, Mat, Neha, Suchandra, Tim

---++ Introduction

We are going to continue tweaking the format of this meeting. For now, we will try to have four main sections to the meeting:

   * Opening: General remarks from Tim, plus a review of some basic status items.
   * Accomplishments: Review of main accomplishments from the past week. Tim will summarize key items from individual status reports and then anyone else may contribute further items.
   * Open Issues: Discussion of open issues relevant to the team, including high priority work. Tim will provide an initial agenda, but anyone else may add items.
   * Tasks: Main tasks to be addressed during the week; review of next actions from above.

---++ Opening

*Triage Duty:* Neha this week, Mat next week. Currently, there are 6 open tickets.

*OSG 3.x Sites:* 47 (+2) last week; 19 using 3.1.8.

---++ Accomplishments

   * Added lots of good packages to the release, including JDK, Condor, Gratia reporting, Gratia probes, netlogger, lcmaps, gram-state, !gLExec.
   * Froze the release package list.
   * Cleared our list of known deployment blockers!
   * Got !jGlobus contributions from Brian and integrated into !BeStMan.

---++ Issues

   * Release 3.1.9 scheduled for Tuesday, 25 September.
   * SHA-2 signed certificates
      * Taking Brian’s contributions, Neha will begin testing the new !BeStMan + !jGlobus combination this week. She needs a pointer to the koji build location.
      * Neha’s GUMS tests: Pre-RFC proxies still fail. Brian added a patch (not contributed back to EMI yet), so Neha will retest.
      * Suchandra’s GUMS tests with SHA-2 certificates: Getting a new error message, cannot find certificate chain. But Neha’s tests with SHA-2 user proxies worked, so Suchandra will continue to investigate.
      * !XRootD: Suchandra did not test with GSI authentication, because osg-test does not do so ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-781][SW-781]]). But !XRootD 3.2.4 (and earlier?) with GSI authentication fail for other reasons, and the developers are working on it.
   * There are odd failures in the nightly tests on SL5 with production osg-test.
   * [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/12536][GOC ticket #12536]] (RSV probe failures at BU): Doug is stuck with this long and complicated ticket. There were some suggestions for how to move forward.
   * We discussed the idea of an OSG Security repository. While not a bad idea, it does not seem to add value at present. We will shelve the idea for now.

---++ Actions

   * Release 3.1.9 (Tim, Mat)
   * Keep pushing hard on all SHA-2 issues:
      * Retest GUMS and pre-RFC proxies (Neha)
      * Retest GUMS with the latest trustmanager (Suchandra)
   * Create a JIRA ticket for the nightly test failures, dump in findings from last week, and then continue investigating (Suchandra, Neha)
   * Help Doug with the RSV ticket from BU (Marco, Mat)
   * Finish packaging osg-pki-tools (Mat)
   * Update osg-build (Mat)
   * Investigate osg-cleanup bug fixes (Mat?)
