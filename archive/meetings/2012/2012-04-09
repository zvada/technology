| [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/11750][11750]] | Mat | Please followup with requester |
| [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/11919][11919]] | Doug & Scot | Since these are JIRA tickets now, can close this ticket |
| [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/11772][11772]] | Neha | Close due to lack of response |

We still have a lot of outstanding VOMS tickets representing issues at Fermilab. Alain is continuing to work on them with Dan and Andrea and progress is being made.

---++  State of testing framework

Tim wants to cut a release of osg-test (probably version 1.1) and asked if anyone else wants to get something in before the release is cut. Neha said she would like to commit a change to the files library (function to replace a line in an existing file) and to commit a Betsman test before that happens.

Tim and Scot propose that if you change one of the test libraries, you should send an email to osg-software with the new Python documentation for it.  

---++  Upcoming releases:
---+++ 3.0.10

This release will be tomorrow, 10-April-2012 and will have:
   * CA certificate update to IGTF 1.46
   * Fixed osg-release RPM
   * Maybe a bug fix for the GRAM job manager, pending Brian's testing

---+++  3.1.0

Everything is in place except that GUMS on SL6 is still missing missing. Mat is working actively on this (it's related to a borked version of maven in jpackage) and hopes to have this resolved within a couple of days. Mat pointed out that to test on SL6, we need the new osg-test release, which changes how we install VOMS on SL6. 

Xin can test new 3.1.0 on ITB. He has two CEs and will update one of them to SL6. He'll also be able to test the worker node.

Suchandra will stand up an SL6 CE this week and test it.

Suchandra says we can test the new release with glideinWMS. 

---++ Status Reports

   * *Doug*: Built og-discovery on SL6. Everything in the storage world is built on SL6, but can't test due to missing SL6 gums-clinet. Mat thinks it will be ready in a couple of days, see above.
   * *Marco*: Nothing to report, except working on a few tickets. 
   * *Mat*: Have been getting final bits of EL6 working. Also working on getting GUMS to build on SL6, getting close to success. Had to switch to alternative version of Maven. Will do 3.0.10 release tomorrow.
   * *Maxim*: Transitioned work to John Hover.
   * *Neha*: Have been working on Bestman tests for osg-test. Also testing old/new proxies with Bestman. It turns out that Bestman 2.2.1 doesn't work with new proxies. Working on [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-617][SOFTWARE-617]], problems with Bestman init scripts. 
   * *Scot*: Closed out most RSV tickets last week. Will cut new RSV release soon. RSV update will go into OSG 3.1. It addresses issues found by Horst for ATLAS, among other things.
   * *Suchandra*: Fixed osg-configure bugs. Working on tests, particularly for osg-configure. He asked about extra configuration files needed by tests: should the test create them or can they be stashed? Tim says they can be stashed, check out how we bring along our test CA. This week will test SL6 and finish up osg-configure tests and finish up ITB glidein deployment. Will be on vacation after Friday for two weeks. 
   * *Terrence*: Terrence has been testing GUMS on the CE and it's working well. He's now going to test with worker nodes hitting GUMS, to see how well we can scale. 
   * *Tim*: Was on vacation.
   * *Xin*: Have been running stress tests with Jaime Frey to test Condor-G with GT5. Doing sustained 5000 job test (i.e. there are always 5000 jobs in the queue). The job manager has been taking a lot of memory, in the range of 3-5GB, which is much bigger than expected. Jaime is in the contact with the Globus team. They will do some memory profiling as part of another test run soon.
