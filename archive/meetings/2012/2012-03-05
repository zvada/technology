---++ State of open software tickets

| <b>On triage duty this week:</b> | Neha |
| <b>Open tickets:</b> | 4 total. 1 high priority |

There has been some confusion about how to handle incoming tickets. 

---+++ Looking at open tickets. 
   * Go to [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/list/open][the GOC ticket page]]
   * Make sure all of the text boxes are empty
   * Type "software" (no quotes) in the "Assignees" text box at the top.

---+++ When to assign tickets. 

This is the overall flow:

   1. A ticket arrives at the GOC, either by email or via the ticket creator
   1. If the ticket arrives via email, then someone at the GOC manually makes a ticket out of it. It's not automatic.
   1. *ASSIGNMENT #1:* The ticket is assigned to a GOC member. They're in charge of ushering the ticket through it's whole lifetime, though for software tickets they won't do a whole lot on the technical work. Note that some software tickets may not be assigned to us, because they might assign them to the VO support center. This is good. 
   1. *ASSIGNMENT #2:* The GOC member looks at the ticket and decides it's a software ticket. (They might do some upfront work if they can.) They then assign it to "Software Support (Triage)". We now have two people assigned to the ticket. 
   1. When assigned to "Software Support (Triage)", all changes to the ticket are sent to <osg-software-support-stream@opensciencegrid.org>, so we leave this pseudo-person on the ticket. Watching the email to this mailing list is a nice (but optional) way for you to see what's happening when you're on triage duty.
   1. *ASSIGNMENT #3:* The person on triage duty assigns it to the right person from the software team. We now have three assignees:
      1. GOC member
      1. Software Support (Triage)
      1. The Software team member who will handle the ticket

---++ Plans for next releases
People's desire for upcoming releases

   * glexec/lcmaps upgrade
   * SL6 support
   * Doug: Xrootd, new version. Will contact Doug Benjamin for urgency on Xrootd release
   * Suchandra: support for new lcmaps in osg-configure; biggest issue is testing for SGE and maybe coverage for LSF. 
   * GUMS
   * globus-gram-job-manager bug fix
   * glideinwms new version. Maybe factory as well. 
   * GIP update
   * Documentation

---++ Status Reports

   * *Doug*: Has been working on Bestman dependencies. With Brian's help, have separate jGlobus dependencies and Bestman is using it as well as some other external dependencies. Smoke tests are good, but needs deeper tests because a lot of dependency versions have changed. 
   * *Marco*: Working with campus grid effort. Nothing for software. Found some old content from opensciencegrid.org that was missed in the Twiki transition. 
   * *Mat*: Worked on GUMS, and it's working, at least on EL5. We've sent it to Terrence for testing. Have done work on test infrastructure for expanded platform coverage.
   * *Maxim*: At a stopping point, need more work. Finished up test aggregation work, waiting for new assignment. Don't know about funding past end of March--he'll talk to his supervisors and let us know.
   * *Neha*: Finished dCache test install and finished up Xrootd documentation. On triage duty this week. Finishing up two documents. Will take over reviewing the HDFS documents. Have installed the osg-test software. Will incorporate a simple test of Bestman into testing infrastructure. 
   * *Suchandra*: Last week, finished up testing OSG 1.2.28. Have been correcting issues in osg-configure that were recently found. Continuing work on glidein deployment on ITB and working with Rob to get Panda jobs running. This week, will work on ITB cluster and Panda and glideinWMS deployment. 
   * *Tim*: Last week: three days of vacation and worked on applications for OSG User School. However, has been watching over expansion of testing onto more platforms. Currently testing on EL5 and EL6 (three platforms each, so six total). We want to expand to six more platforms, but pre-release testing repository, so we can catch problems in advance. Mat is working on this too. Also working on bigger picture plans for testing.
