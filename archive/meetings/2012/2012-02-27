---++ Readiness for tomorrow's releases

---+++ OSG Software 1.2.28

Both Suchandra and Scot say we are all ready to go.

---+++ OSG Software 3.0.8

We will ship 3.0.8 this week, including Scientific Linux 6 support for the worker node client. 

We hope to ship on Tuesday, but [[http://jira.globus.org/browse/GRAM-317][a bug in GRAM]] might cause us to hold back by a day or two. It's causing serious problems at Nebraska's production CE, and we might have an easy fix for it. 

---++ SL6 in 3.0.9?

Alain will soon begin planning for OSG Software 3.0.9. He casually proposed fully supporting all of OSG Software on SL6 and asked if people know of any reason that might be unrealistic. Other than the obvious (we haven't tried everything so we don't know) people are okay with it. 

---++ Testing Updates

We recently expanded our testing to cover EL6 (Scientific Linux 6, !CentOS 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6), so the number of daily emails with test results have doubled. We're going to double again, hopefully by the end of the week as we start testing against the pre-release EL5 and EL6 versions. The email load is clearly terrible, but Maxim has done work to aggregate our test results (but for email and on the web) and Mat will work on deploying these this week. Hopefully we'll have a manageable system for viewing the test results by the end of the week.

We talked briefly about test coverage. Neha asked where instructions are for running the test suite. They are at: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/AutomatedTests

---++ Timeline for GUMS testing
Suchandra asked about the timeline for GUMS testing. GUMS 1.3.x is fully packaged and works in basic tests, but it has a giant memory leak that makes it mostly unusable (unless you restart it daily). When that's fixed, we'll do widespread testing.

---++ Stable EPEL mirror
Suchandra asked about the state of the stable EPEL mirror that we've discussed on other occasions. Alain talked about it with John Hover earlier. Because BNL has OSG software effort and because they really care about it, John agreed to investigate it. He's been on vacation recently, so Alain does not know the current state. He'll look into it. 

---++ Status Reports

   * *Doug*: Has been working on Xrootd documentation. Has been working on Bestman plugins to deal with problems experienced by a user. Dug into redoing the dependencies for Bestman. Because of problems, instead of doing one at a time he's diving in and doing a whole bunch at once. A bit harder than he thought it would be. Current guess is that it's a week's worth of work. Also did work on glideinwms vo frontend, and for the first time we have an RPM for the glideinwms factory!
   * *Marco*: Has been working on documentation and testing. But he mainly did user support this week. 
   * *Mat*: Will be working this week to use the new test aggregation with our daily tests. Also working to expand test platform coverage. Will do OSG Software 3.0.8 release. This will be the first release on EL5 and EL6, so has been improving our release process to handle multiple platforms. Finished packaging GUMS, but waiting for bug fix from John.
   * *Maxim*: Worked on the test aggregation: have scripts to create an HTML page to show the issues and to write a single email with the recent test results.
   * *Neha*: Review and testing the xrootd documentation. There were problems with it, so Doug updated it and she's reviewing it again. Updating dCache testing stand in FermiCloud. This will help us to validate dCache Gratia probes and to validate the Bestman client tools. 
   * *Scot*: Fixed RSV bugs, especially with the consumers. 
   * *Suchandra*: Tested 3.0.8 on SL6, Tested Gratia probes, Pacman release, Fixed osg-configure bugs. This week will finish up osg-configure for Gratia configuration. Will work on Digicert testing. 
   * *Tim*: See testing above. osg-test has reached version 1.0.0! All basic tests we initially planned for are in place. Now we'll expand platform coverage, better reporting on tests, Test Fest to expand scope of tests. Also working hard on OSG Summer School: applications open a week from today.
