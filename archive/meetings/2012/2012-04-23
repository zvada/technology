---++ Readiness for OSG Software 3.1 Release

Everyone agrees we are ready for release. Scot is building a new RSV right now (but tested under a different version number), Doug tested the SE on SL6 last week, and Tim says that the nightly test failures are all due to test problems, _not_ software problems. 

---++ Status Reports

   * *Alain*: Trained the OGS GOC on supporting the OSG Software Stack last week. ([[Operations.VDTSoftwareTraining][Details]])
   * *Doug*: Last week was testing of SL6 installs. Tested HDFS and Bestman onto Fermicloud, and they're all working. Good to go on SL6 release. This week Doug will be pushing on releasing the new Betsman release that removes dependecies from the build. 
   * *Marco*: Nothing to report.
   * *Mat*: Last week, solved problems with JDK package (installing on top of official JDK broke /usr/bin/java symlink). Will be in the release. Debugged problem with lcmaps that prevented installs and updated on 32-bit platforms. 
   * *Neha*: Spent a lot of time catching up FermiCloud support and operations. Worked on 32-bit support in FermiCloud, and it's nearly there. The dCache test stand now is now up with static IPs and good names, currently installing dCache on them. Did a lot of software support. Started new ticket on GUMS client problems that needs John's help.
   * *Scot*: Mostly working on class last week. Wrapping up RSV odds and ends, will cut release today.
   * *Tim*: Released osg-test this morning, tests will start running shortly. Haven't had time to code reviews yet, but will do so soon. 
   * *Xin*: Site still up and running. Will try out EL6 RPMs on worker nodes soon, working with support group to do so. Was briefly confused by lfc-python26 not being needed on SL6 anymore because lfc-python defaults to Python 2.6. (And Marco confirmed that Python 2.4 support is definitely not needed on SL6 anymore.) Will run ATLAS jobs on it soon.
