---+ LFC Upgrade for ATLAS Requirements

ATLAS is requesting a LFC upgrade. There are two options, and they prefer Option 1 if possible:

*Option 1*: Upgrade to LFC 1.8.0-1<br>
*Option 2*: Overlay the Python LFC clients from 1.8.0-1 on top of the existing VDT LFC 1.7.4-7 installation. 

In either case, we need the following for the Pacman-based installation of LFC:

   1. Both the 32- and 64-bit version of the libraries and Python interfaces should be installed. The executables should be installed as 32- or 64-bit based on the computer on which it is being installed. But because the installation may be done on a shared disk, both the 32- and 64-bit libraries and Python interfaces should be installed. 
   1. We need to provide the Python interfaces for three versions of Python: 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6.
   1. The VDT's setup.sh file should set up PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH appropriately. 

The VDT also has a test version of the worker node client RPMs, which includes LFC. (We hope to move this to production in the near future.) In this case, it is okay to have separate 32 and 64 bit installations since they can be easily installed side-by-side or separately. However, we still need to meet the other requirements (three versions of PYTHON, environment properly configured). 

The new LFC is only needed on Scientific Linux 5, *not* Scientific Linux 4 or any other platform. 

Right now, the VDT provides Python 2.4.6 in some installations, including the VDT-Client. For now, that doesn't need to be removed because it is not part of the worker install and the new wlcg-client will not include the full VDT-Client. 

Compared to other major ATLAS requests, the relative priorities are, from highest to lowest priority:

   1. LFC update
   1. !Xrootd
   1. !CREAM
